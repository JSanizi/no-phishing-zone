PLEASE READ THIS ALL!!!!!!!!! !!!! NOT A SCAM!!!! = !!! I REPEAT NOT A SCAM!!! THIS ONLY COST YOU 6.00 CASH!!! = INVESTMENT!!! IT DOES WORK!!! I found this on a bulletin board and = decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through = newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to = this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with = only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, Yeah right, this must = be a scam"", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. = Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address = stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the = bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 = newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after = thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about = trying it. I figured: ""what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and = $6.00, right?"" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... = Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I = figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my = first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had = made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 = and it's still growing. This is how my fourth week and I have made a = total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's = certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the = lottery!!(This is not me but i am also making alot of = money) Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, = WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so = you can get the information off of it, as you need it. I promise you = that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making = more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! = Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or = download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the as money comes = in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus = postage) IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; = it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works! If all of = the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive = extraordinary dividends. PLEASE NOTE: Please follow = these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 = days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and = integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully = adhering to the instructions. You will be part of the Mail Order = business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's = a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many = large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. = However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the = income, which is made from people like you and me asking to be included = in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to success: STEP 1: Get = 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of = paper ""PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST."" Now get 6 US $1.00 bills = and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not = be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one = paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 = sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, = your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating = a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate = service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little = skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I = checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they = confirmed that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following = addresses: #1) Mike Gordon, 204 South Maple St., Winchester, = KY.40391 #2) Jeff Waldrop, 39-A Lucy Rd., Laurel, MS 39443 #3) = Brian Thompson, 15 Briggs Pond WY. Sharon, MA 02067 #4) A. Guy , = 6127 Seabree LN, ,Ft. Wayne, In 46835 #5) Wes Armstrong, 157 = Butternut Rd., Shavertown, PA 18708 #6) Trista Friend, P.O. Box = 1265, Long Beach, WA 98631 STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the = list that you see above, move the other names up 1 place (#2 becomes = #1, #3 becomes #2, etc.) and add YOUR name and address as number 6 on = the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep = this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your = amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to = 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the = more money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy. = This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 = Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these = steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, = and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful = because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their = carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of = integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many = others have received will come your way. NOTE: You may want to = retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard = copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are = truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 = bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post = is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be = reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar = each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your = name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars = in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the = first six people listed above) Send it now, and add your own name to the = list and you're in business! -----DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO = POST TO NEWSGROUPS-------------- Step 1) You do not need to re-type = this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the = beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this = document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the = entire letter into the computer's memory. Step 2) Open a blank = 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From = the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter = into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step = 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your = postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back = to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching = for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, = discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this = article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and = selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will = be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of = postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're = done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to = do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang = of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! = **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU = WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** that's it! = You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You = may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of = mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent = a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE = ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. ** Now, each of the 5 persons who = just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at = #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another = $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at = #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, = those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at = #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! = OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM = 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, = that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this = message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per = 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original = investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the = list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out = another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. = And start posting again. Do you TURN 6 (six) DOLLARS INTO $6000 or even = $60000 EASY AND HONESTLY!!! The thing to remember is: do you = realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the = Internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! = So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... = People have said, ""what if the plan is played out and no one sends you = the money?"" So what! What are the chances of that happening when there = are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the = Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? = Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands = of those joining the actual Internet.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Majee

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!",1,0

Maybe I'm the only one confused but what you are saying is that you
have a spamtrap that receives Bugtraq messages and you are auto-
matically reporting them as SPAM only to revoke them shortly there-
after???  Either way automatic reporting is a Bad Thing (tm) IMHO.
You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.  I'm not
sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs
nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you
are doing that it negatively impacts your rating at a near exponential
rate with every report/revoke cycle.

Well, I'm hardly a Gaeilgir, but in general I wouldn't consider
either ability or inability in a language something to be proud
of... maybe it's just me, but I'm not proud that I can't speak
Italian, no more than I'm proud that I can speak French or
English.

PlayStation owners win copyright case

Owners of PlayStation consoles who modify their machines to play games
bought overseas have had a win in the Federal Court.

Sony Computer Entertainment has failed in its claim that ""chipping"" breaks
copyright laws.

Sony launched legal proceedings against a Sydney man, Eddy Stevens, for
allegedly selling pirated games and also providing and installing
modification chips.

PlayStation consoles in Australia are different from those in the US and
Japan because of the different television formats.

The court was told ""chipping"" allows people to play legitimately bought
overseas games and copies of games, but also pirated games.

The judgement by Federal Court Justice Ronald Sackville says Sony failed
to prove that PlayStation consoles have a copyright protection measure
installed in the first place and therefore could not rule that a mod chip
breaks copyright legislation.

Mr Stevens was found to have infringed trademark rules in relation to the
pirated games he sold a matter which will come before the court again next
month.

Groups Sponsor ---------------------~--> 4 DVDs Free +s&p Join Now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6YBB/NXiEAA/Ey.GAA/26EolB/TM ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> A new version of unison is now available for testing.  It incorporates several small improvements over 2.9.1, but the main change is a fix to a bug that had potentially serious safety consequences, but only for the very small number of users that are in the habit of running more than one instance of Unison at a time, in parallel.  These users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.  Others can wait if they wish. The release includes pre-built executables for Linux and Solaris, but not Windows.  (We are looking for a Unison-Windows maintainer -- at the moment, none of the active developers are regularly using Unison on Windows, and we do not have a machine that is configured properly for building executables for export.) Grab it from here:    http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download.html Enjoy,         -- Benjamin    Changes since 2.9.1:      * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number        of simultaneous file transfers.      * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files        are stored.      * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes        when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and        switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'        and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet        fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks        will not be synchronized correctly.)      * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to        the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The        reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to        silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and        we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to        other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g.        synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for        this suggestion.      * Several small user interface improvements      * Documentation           + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as             separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web             page.           + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance             tuning.      * Makefile           + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk             automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk             installed           + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX            Changes since 2.8.1:      * Changing profile works again under Windows      * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy        instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by        a boolean option ``xferbycopying''.      * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data        transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.]      * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically        linked).      * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and        Unix      * Small improvements:           + If neither the             tt USERPROFILE nor the             tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put             its temporary commit log (called             tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the             tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use             tt C:.           + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no =             false; default = auto.           + -silent implies -contactquietly      * Source code:           + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of             the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific             stuff can be made available for other projects.)           + several Makefile and docs changes (for release);           + further comments in ``update.ml'';           + connection information is not stored in global variables             anymore.            Changes since 2.7.78:      * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid        leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs        after Unison exited).            Changes since 2.7.39:      * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs        are now both accessible).      * User manual revised.      * Added some new preferences:           + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh             programs.           + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server''             message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI).      * Bug fixes:           + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed             column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to             change.           + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop             if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode.           + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii             characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI.             (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the             people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii             filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes             things.)           + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was             reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.)      * User interface and Unison behavior:           + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI.           + Added exit status for the textual user interface.           + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or             errors during update detection are now noted in the log file.           + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format           + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that             tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of             failing.           + Made some improvements to the error messages.           + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml.            Changes since 2.7.7:      * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system.        It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much        more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the        earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread        library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,        non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This        version appears stable.        Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the        multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to        the user interface and logging, for example:           + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the             beginning, one for the end.           + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left             by a previous unison run, because warning does not work             nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made             less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by             the user. They take the form             .#..unison.tmp.      * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes        Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just        those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked        as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart        Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a        previous run.      * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the        initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even        if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,        when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume        mounted.)      * Small improvements and bug fixes:           + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather             than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from             them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these             warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who             have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their             prefs files may now get error reports.           + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name             and line number.           + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to             the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed             only in identical ways since last sync.''           + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference             files.           + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first             marshaled.           + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously             changing file: unison will give up after certain number of             retries.           + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger             (force=older preference not working).      * Compilation:           + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk             1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under             Windows).           + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform             with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports             building dynamically linked unison executables.            Changes since 2.7.4:      * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup        sequence.            Changes since 2.7.1:      * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which        preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are        added to.      * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so        that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This        bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to        tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old        version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an        error message.)            Changes since 2.6.59:      * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal        values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or        default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when        running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is        default.      * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All        preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward        compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not        mentioned in the manual any more.      * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now        named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than        appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge        programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file        contents.      * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure        that the server times out if the communication link is        unexpectedly broken.      * Bug fixes:           + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination             file.           + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind             a followed link.           + Several other small fixes.            Changes since 2.6.38:      * Major Windows performance improvement!        We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at        a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it        has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking        for updates in large replicas.        When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as        'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates,        instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause        Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time,        modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the        update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However,        Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the        other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just        before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this        switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with        fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have        overlooked an update.        Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested.        If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what        Unison is doing.      * New functionality: centralized backups and merging           + This version incorporates two pieces of major new             functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer             internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps             a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a             merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external             file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to             individual files.           + Centralized backups:                o Unison now maintains full backups of the                  last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in                  each replica; these function both as backups in the                  usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking                  external merge programs.                o The backed up files are stored in a directory                  /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this                  directory can be changed by setting the environment                  variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.)                o The predicate backup controls which files are actually                  backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *'                  causes backing up of all files.                o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison                  updates its archive. This means that                     # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch                       (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the                       archive files have been manually deleted), all                       files will be backed up.                     # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first                       time unison propagates an update for it.                o The preference backupversions controls how many previous                  versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e.,                  the last synchronized version plus one backup).                o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is                  also still supported, but backup is now preferred.                o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup                  directory (or to throw away the directory itself).                  Before unison uses any of these files for anything                  important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the                  one that it expects.           + Merging:                o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command,                  invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected).                o The actual merging is performed by an external program.                  The preferences merge and merge2 control how this                  program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file                  (see the backup preference), then the merge preference                  is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In                  both cases, the value of the preference should be a                  string representing the command that should be passed to                  a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string,                  the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD                  may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as                  follows before invoking the command:                     # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy                       of the file;                     # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary                       file, into which the contents of the remote copy of                       the file have been transferred by Unison prior to                       performing the merge;                     # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file                       that Unison expects to be written by the merge                       program when it finishes, giving the desired new                       contents of the file; and                     # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy                       of the original version of the file (i.e., its                       state at the end of the last successful run of                       Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not                       merge2).                  For example, on Unix systems setting the merge                  preference to    merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW                  will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for                  merging.                  A large number of external merging programs are                  available. For example, emacs users may find the                  following convenient:     merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2""                nil ""NEW"")'     merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor                ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")'                  (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid                  running off the edge of the page. In your preference                  file, each should be written on a single line.)                o If the external program exits without leaving any file                  at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have                  failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW                  but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison                  considers the merge to have succeeded but to have                  generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke                  an external editor so that the user can resolve the                  conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls                  what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs.                o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of                  the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give                  several examples in the manual.      * Smaller changes:           + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer             adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a             file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison             directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf,             as it did before. (This change means that included preference             files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that             unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file'             dialog.)           + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and             a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger,             but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't             depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library             modules being available.           + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting             the propagation direction exactly backwards.           + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to             crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does             not exist.           + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first             created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in             reverse order in the user interface.      * For developers:           + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source             distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective             developers with navigating the code.            Changes since 2.6.11:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed.      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely        rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is        that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can        be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include        directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath        in existing profiles should be changed to path.        Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is        that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile        and on the command line.        You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile        into two:   default.prf =       root = blah       root = foo       include common   common.prf =               Now do   unison common root1 root2        when you want to specify roots explicitly.      * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users        to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be        propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For        symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.)        The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is        also set.        The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities        on a one-off basis via the Actions menu.      * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be        relocated without changing the name of the archive file where        Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for        experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for        more information.)      * Graphical user-interface:           + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for             switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from             scratch.           + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used             profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key             = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will             cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin             synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may             have been selected for a set of changes currently being             displayed will be discarded.)           + Each profile may include a preference 'label = '             giving a descriptive string that described the options             selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the             profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed             in the top-right corner of the main Unison window.      * Minor:           + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to             order the files backwards relative to the main user             interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.)           + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check             the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically             fall back to the textual user interface.           + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched             against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both             specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be             skipped.           + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements.            Changes since 2.6.1:      * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for        directories.      * Preference files may now include lines of the form include ,        which will cause name.prf to be read at that point.      * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now        works properly.      * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that        the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context.      * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used        together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server        command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd        preference if there is one, or else just unison.      * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean        values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.)      * Lot of small bugs fixed.            Changes since 2.5.31:      * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log        file seems useful for most users.      * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks).            Changes since 2.5.25:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again).      * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed.            Changes since 2.5.1:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * New functionality:           + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and             group-ids.             These new features are controlled by a set of new             preferences, all of which are currently false by default.                o When the times preference is set to true, file                  modification times are propaged. (Because the                  representations of time may not have the same                  granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be                  able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will                  get them as close as the operating systems involved                  allow.)                o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership                  information is synchronized.                o When the group preference is set to true, group                  information is synchronized.                o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and                  group information is synchronized numerically. By                  default, owner and group numbers are converted to names                  on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The                  special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never                  mapped via user/group names even if this preference is                  not set.)           + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to             control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this             preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should             be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but             the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing             theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to             synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this             preference to -1.           + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison             keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the             replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called             unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the             HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else,             set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want             Unison to use.           + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of             patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored,             whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path             will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does             not match any ignorenot patterns.)      * User-interface improvements:           + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same             order as they were given on the command line or in the             preferences file.           + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user             interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it             displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory             window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on             going.           + Added a new preference for controlling how many status             messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth             controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine             (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory             paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1.           + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem             very useful, and there were too many preferences for             controlling output in various ways.           + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one             that will be used if the user just types ) instead of             all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of             possibilities.           + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local             host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of             the archive file used to remember which files have been             synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system             call. However, if the environment variable             UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used             instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations             where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it             is a laptop and gets moved around a lot).           + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail             window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is             configured to synchronize them.      * For hackers:           + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which             means we can throw away our local patched version.             If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources,             you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers             release, available from             http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html             (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit             challenging.)           + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been             cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should             be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to             contribute their programming energies. There is also a             separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs.           + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being             maintained and no longer compiles).           + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional             information that should be useful for identifying sources of             problems.           + The version number of the remote server is now checked right             away during the connection setup handshake, rather than             later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that             turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better             to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either             client or server.)           + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha             linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these             architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone             would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a             link to them.      * Bug fixes:           + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive             when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of             the replicas is on a windows machine).           + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during             propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported             as having changed during synchronization. This should be             fixed.           + Numerous smaller fixes.            Changes since 2.4.1:      * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By        default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the        rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This        behavior can be changed in the following ways:           + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly             created files to be displayed before changed files.           + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing             order of size.           + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where  is             a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow'             patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed             first.           + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes             paths matching this pattern to be displayed last.        The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user        manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed        from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface.      * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's        fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead        of a synchronizer.           + Giving the preference prefer with argument  (by adding             -prefer  to the command line or prefer=) to your             profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of              should be propagated to the other replica (with no             questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as             usual.           + Giving the preference force with argument  will make             unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root,             even if it was the other replica that was changed.        These options should be used with care! (More information is        available in the manual.)      * Small changes:           + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in             the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive).           + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to             activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync             compression is now enabled by default).           + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which             direction changes are being propagated are printed             differently when the user has overridded Unison's default             recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the             behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such             arrows in a different color.           + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of             lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility.           + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual.            Changes since 2.3.12:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * New/improved functionality:           + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which             changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true,             the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default             setting is false.)           + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to             be listed before other updates in the user interface.           + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port.           + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and             we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your             profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified             without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a             file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to             saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access             saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old             effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.)           + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are             given but no profile is given on the command line. The new             behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it             does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The             manual claimed that this case would work by reading no             profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true.           + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always             listed first           + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which             version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal             values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison             use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh'             command.)           + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the             same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report             a spurious conflict)      * Improvements for the Windows version:           + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under             Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior             is described in the cross-platform section of the manual.           + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares,             e.g., //host/drive/path.           + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in             Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug:             Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows.      * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no        longer being maintained):           + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they             have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's             default recommendation.           + More colorful appearance.           + The initial profile selection window works better.           + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is             displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of             the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the             top).           + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of             total bytes that have been transferred so far.      * Improvements to the text user interface:           + The file details will be displayed automatically when a             conflict is been detected.           + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left             over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer             wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode.           + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time             it waits for user interaction.           + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and             starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when             asked whether to propagate changes.           + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed             immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more             questions.      * Documentation and installation changes:           + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common             problems and on tricks contributed by users.           + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly             say what are the current stable and beta-test version             numbers.           + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers'             version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at             any given time!) are now available from the download page.           + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform             issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames)      * Many small bug fixes and random improvements.            Changes since 2.3.1:      * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module        that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a        'rename' error.            Changes since 2.2:      * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default.        (It is not stable enough yet.)      * Various bug fixes.      * A new experimental feature:        The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard        specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on        the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing        the contents of that directory.        Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you        will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the *        from being interpreted by your shell.        If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be        used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one        after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first        in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command        line or in the preferences file.)            Changes since 2.1:      * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain        Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync        protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a        small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs.        This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on        fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so        we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync        option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on.      * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers,        showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far.      * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be        have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is        incremented on every significant public release and the third        component is the ``patch level.''      * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface.      * The manual is now available in PDF format.      * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport        subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much        more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is        not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the        release version of Unison.        If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need        to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the        documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to        true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with        the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by        checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml        standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the        end.)            Changes since 1.292:      * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the        first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all        the files in both repositories).      * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail        after the client exits.      * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK        interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally).            Changes since 1.231:      * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See        the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions.      * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the        rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This        protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of        a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync        feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync        switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do:        you may not notice much speedup yet.)      * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem,        written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still        single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version,        you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.)        Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the        option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent        threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded        clients/servers can interoperate.      * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques        Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting        development effort to the GTK interface from now on.      * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The        modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk        instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you        must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in        c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure        to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by        default).      * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use        unison- instead of just unison as the remote        server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist        conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the        client, the same version will be selected on the server.            Changes since 1.219:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including:           + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not             working.           + umask is now ignored when creating directories           + directories are create writable, so that a read-only             directory and its contents can be propagated.           + Handling of warnings generated by the server.           + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both             sides is now flagged as erroneous.           + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant             roots.                o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated                  onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the                  link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself,                  which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the                  link is completely invisible)                o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root                  on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not                  calculate the working directory into which to write                  changes. This should be fixed.      * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive        files.      * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond        better.      * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going        back to previous items)      * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be        easier to find / download things now.            Changes since 1.200:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows.      * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the        same time as the replicas are being changed by the user.      * Internal performance improvements.            Changes since 1.190:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the        amount of memory allocation, especially during the first        synchronization. This should help power users with very big        replicas.      * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in        preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later        release.      * Miscellaneous bug fixes.            Changes since 1.180:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns.      * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from        working correctly when click-started.      * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were        causing spurious reports of different permissions when        synchronizing between windows and unix systems.      * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which        was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large        replicas.            Changes since 1.169:      * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files.      * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing        functions. Some power users have reported success with very large        replicas.      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored        automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an        appropriate ignore pattern in your profile.      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has        changed. Instead of putting a line of the form                  ignore =         in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put:                  ignore = Regexp         Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized:                  ignore = Name         matches any path in which one component matches , while                  ignore = Path         matches exactly the path .        Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in  and        :           + a ? matches any single character except /           + a * matches any sequence of characters not including /           + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }           + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.        See the user manual for some examples.            Changes since 1.146:      * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge        directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list        processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please        give it a try and let us know.      * Major additions to the documentation.            Changes since 1.142:      * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes.      * Major additions to the user manual.      * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt        automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots        to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical        UI from a desktop icon.      * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such        signal' exception.            Changes since 1.139:      * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled        with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not        to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've        heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using        precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade.      * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of        various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module        XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything.      * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such        signal' exception.            Changes since 1.111:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files        in the .unison directory have changed. In particular:           + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf           + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into             default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should             become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf.      * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the        manual for details.      * You can now have different preference files in your .unison        directory. If you start unison like this              unison profilename        (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the        file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of        default.prf.      * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface      * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server        process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using        sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created        using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server        is left running.)      * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server        started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This        may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode        server has finished initalization.)      * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development        tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack        around with.      * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make        Unison better.         Changes in Version 2.9.20    Changes since 2.9.1:      * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number        of simultaneous file transfers.      * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files        are stored.      * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes        when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and        switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'        and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet        fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks        will not be synchronized correctly.)      * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to        the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The        reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to        silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and        we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to        other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g.        synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for        this suggestion.      * Several small user interface improvements      * Documentation           + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as             separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web             page.           + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance             tuning.      * Makefile           + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk             automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk             installed           + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX            Changes since 2.8.1:      * Changing profile works again under Windows      * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy        instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by        a boolean option ``xferbycopying''.      * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data        transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.]      * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically        linked).      * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and        Unix      * Small improvements:           + If neither the             tt USERPROFILE nor the             tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put             its temporary commit log (called             tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the             tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use             tt C:.           + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no =             false; default = auto.           + -silent implies -contactquietly      * Source code:           + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of             the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific             stuff can be made available for other projects.)           + several Makefile and docs changes (for release);           + further comments in ``update.ml'';           + connection information is not stored in global variables             anymore.            Changes since 2.7.78:      * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid        leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs        after Unison exited).            Changes since 2.7.39:      * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs        are now both accessible).      * User manual revised.      * Added some new preferences:           + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh             programs.           + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server''             message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI).      * Bug fixes:           + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed             column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to             change.           + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop             if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode.           + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii             characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI.             (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the             people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii             filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes             things.)           + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was             reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.)      * User interface and Unison behavior:           + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI.           + Added exit status for the textual user interface.           + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or             errors during update detection are now noted in the log file.           + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format           + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that             tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of             failing.           + Made some improvements to the error messages.           + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml.            Changes since 2.7.7:      * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system.        It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much        more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the        earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread        library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,        non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This        version appears stable.        Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the        multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to        the user interface and logging, for example:           + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the             beginning, one for the end.           + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left             by a previous unison run, because warning does not work             nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made             less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by             the user. They take the form             .#..unison.tmp.      * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes        Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just        those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked        as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart        Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a        previous run.      * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the        initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even        if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,        when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume        mounted.)      * Small improvements and bug fixes:           + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather             than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from             them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these             warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who             have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their             prefs files may now get error reports.           + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name             and line number.           + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to             the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed             only in identical ways since last sync.''           + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference             files.           + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first             marshaled.           + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously             changing file: unison will give up after certain number of             retries.           + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger             (force=older preference not working).      * Compilation:           + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk             1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under             Windows).           + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform             with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports             building dynamically linked unison executables.            Changes since 2.7.4:      * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup        sequence.            Changes since 2.7.1:      * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which        preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are        added to.      * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so        that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This        bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to        tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old        version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an        error message.)            Changes since 2.6.59:      * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal        values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or        default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when        running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is        default.      * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All        preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward        compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not        mentioned in the manual any more.      * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now        named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than        appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge        programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file        contents.      * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure        that the server times out if the communication link is        unexpectedly broken.      * Bug fixes:           + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination             file.           + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind             a followed link.           + Several other small fixes.            Changes since 2.6.38:      * Major Windows performance improvement!        We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at        a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it        has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking        for updates in large replicas.        When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as        'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates,        instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause        Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time,        modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the        update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However,        Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the        other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just        before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this        switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with        fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have        overlooked an update.        Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested.        If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what        Unison is doing.      * New functionality: centralized backups and merging           + This version incorporates two pieces of major new             functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer             internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps             a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a             merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external             file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to             individual files.           + Centralized backups:                o Unison now maintains full backups of the                  last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in                  each replica; these function both as backups in the                  usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking                  external merge programs.                o The backed up files are stored in a directory                  /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this                  directory can be changed by setting the environment                  variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.)                o The predicate backup controls which files are actually                  backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *'                  causes backing up of all files.                o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison                  updates its archive. This means that                     # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch                       (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the                       archive files have been manually deleted), all                       files will be backed up.                     # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first                       time unison propagates an update for it.                o The preference backupversions controls how many previous                  versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e.,                  the last synchronized version plus one backup).                o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is                  also still supported, but backup is now preferred.                o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup                  directory (or to throw away the directory itself).                  Before unison uses any of these files for anything                  important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the                  one that it expects.           + Merging:                o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command,                  invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected).                o The actual merging is performed by an external program.                  The preferences merge and merge2 control how this                  program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file                  (see the backup preference), then the merge preference                  is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In                  both cases, the value of the preference should be a                  string representing the command that should be passed to                  a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string,                  the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD                  may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as                  follows before invoking the command:                     # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy                       of the file;                     # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary                       file, into which the contents of the remote copy of                       the file have been transferred by Unison prior to                       performing the merge;                     # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file                       that Unison expects to be written by the merge                       program when it finishes, giving the desired new                       contents of the file; and                     # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy                       of the original version of the file (i.e., its                       state at the end of the last successful run of                       Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not                       merge2).                  For example, on Unix systems setting the merge                  preference to    merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW                  will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for                  merging.                  A large number of external merging programs are                  available. For example, emacs users may find the                  following convenient:     merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2""                nil ""NEW"")'     merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor                ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")'                  (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid                  running off the edge of the page. In your preference                  file, each should be written on a single line.)                o If the external program exits without leaving any file                  at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have                  failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW                  but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison                  considers the merge to have succeeded but to have                  generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke                  an external editor so that the user can resolve the                  conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls                  what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs.                o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of                  the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give                  several examples in the manual.      * Smaller changes:           + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer             adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a             file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison             directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf,             as it did before. (This change means that included preference             files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that             unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file'             dialog.)           + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and             a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger,             but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't             depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library             modules being available.           + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting             the propagation direction exactly backwards.           + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to             crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does             not exist.           + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first             created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in             reverse order in the user interface.      * For developers:           + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source             distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective             developers with navigating the code.            Changes since 2.6.11:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed.      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely        rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is        that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can        be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include        directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath        in existing profiles should be changed to path.        Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is        that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile        and on the command line.        You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile        into two:   default.prf =       root = blah       root = foo       include common   common.prf =               Now do   unison common root1 root2        when you want to specify roots explicitly.      * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users        to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be        propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For        symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.)        The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is        also set.        The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities        on a one-off basis via the Actions menu.      * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be        relocated without changing the name of the archive file where        Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for        experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for        more information.)      * Graphical user-interface:           + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for             switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from             scratch.           + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used             profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key             = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will             cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin             synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may             have been selected for a set of changes currently being             displayed will be discarded.)           + Each profile may include a preference 'label = '             giving a descriptive string that described the options             selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the             profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed             in the top-right corner of the main Unison window.      * Minor:           + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to             order the files backwards relative to the main user             interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.)           + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check             the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically             fall back to the textual user interface.           + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched             against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both             specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be             skipped.           + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements.            Changes since 2.6.1:      * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for        directories.      * Preference files may now include lines of the form include ,        which will cause name.prf to be read at that point.      * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now        works properly.      * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that        the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context.      * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used        together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server        command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd        preference if there is one, or else just unison.      * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean        values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.)      * Lot of small bugs fixed.            Changes since 2.5.31:      * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log        file seems useful for most users.      * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks).            Changes since 2.5.25:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again).      * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed.            Changes since 2.5.1:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * New functionality:           + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and             group-ids.             These new features are controlled by a set of new             preferences, all of which are currently false by default.                o When the times preference is set to true, file                  modification times are propaged. (Because the                  representations of time may not have the same                  granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be                  able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will                  get them as close as the operating systems involved                  allow.)                o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership                  information is synchronized.                o When the group preference is set to true, group                  information is synchronized.                o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and                  group information is synchronized numerically. By                  default, owner and group numbers are converted to names                  on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The                  special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never                  mapped via user/group names even if this preference is                  not set.)           + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to             control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this             preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should             be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but             the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing             theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to             synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this             preference to -1.           + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison             keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the             replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called             unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the             HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else,             set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want             Unison to use.           + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of             patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored,             whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path             will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does             not match any ignorenot patterns.)      * User-interface improvements:           + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same             order as they were given on the command line or in the             preferences file.           + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user             interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it             displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory             window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on             going.           + Added a new preference for controlling how many status             messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth             controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine             (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory             paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1.           + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem             very useful, and there were too many preferences for             controlling output in various ways.           + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one             that will be used if the user just types ) instead of             all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of             possibilities.           + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local             host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of             the archive file used to remember which files have been             synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system             call. However, if the environment variable             UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used             instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations             where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it             is a laptop and gets moved around a lot).           + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail             window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is             configured to synchronize them.      * For hackers:           + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which             means we can throw away our local patched version.             If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources,             you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers             release, available from             http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html             (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit             challenging.)           + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been             cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should             be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to             contribute their programming energies. There is also a             separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs.           + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being             maintained and no longer compiles).           + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional             information that should be useful for identifying sources of             problems.           + The version number of the remote server is now checked right             away during the connection setup handshake, rather than             later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that             turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better             to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either             client or server.)           + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha             linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these             architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone             would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a             link to them.      * Bug fixes:           + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive             when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of             the replicas is on a windows machine).           + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during             propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported             as having changed during synchronization. This should be             fixed.           + Numerous smaller fixes.            Changes since 2.4.1:      * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By        default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the        rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This        behavior can be changed in the following ways:           + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly             created files to be displayed before changed files.           + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing             order of size.           + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where  is             a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow'             patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed             first.           + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes             paths matching this pattern to be displayed last.        The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user        manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed        from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface.      * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's        fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead        of a synchronizer.           + Giving the preference prefer with argument  (by adding             -prefer  to the command line or prefer=) to your             profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of              should be propagated to the other replica (with no             questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as             usual.           + Giving the preference force with argument  will make             unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root,             even if it was the other replica that was changed.        These options should be used with care! (More information is        available in the manual.)      * Small changes:           + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in             the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive).           + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to             activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync             compression is now enabled by default).           + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which             direction changes are being propagated are printed             differently when the user has overridded Unison's default             recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the             behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such             arrows in a different color.           + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of             lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility.           + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual.            Changes since 2.3.12:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * New/improved functionality:           + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which             changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true,             the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default             setting is false.)           + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to             be listed before other updates in the user interface.           + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port.           + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and             we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your             profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified             without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a             file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to             saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access             saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old             effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.)           + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are             given but no profile is given on the command line. The new             behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it             does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The             manual claimed that this case would work by reading no             profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true.           + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always             listed first           + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which             version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal             values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison             use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh'             command.)           + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the             same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report             a spurious conflict)      * Improvements for the Windows version:           + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under             Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior             is described in the cross-platform section of the manual.           + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares,             e.g., //host/drive/path.           + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in             Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug:             Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows.      * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no        longer being maintained):           + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they             have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's             default recommendation.           + More colorful appearance.           + The initial profile selection window works better.           + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is             displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of             the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the             top).           + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of             total bytes that have been transferred so far.      * Improvements to the text user interface:           + The file details will be displayed automatically when a             conflict is been detected.           + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left             over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer             wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode.           + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time             it waits for user interaction.           + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and             starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when             asked whether to propagate changes.           + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed             immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more             questions.      * Documentation and installation changes:           + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common             problems and on tricks contributed by users.           + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly             say what are the current stable and beta-test version             numbers.           + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers'             version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at             any given time!) are now available from the download page.           + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform             issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames)      * Many small bug fixes and random improvements.            Changes since 2.3.1:      * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module        that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a        'rename' error.            Changes since 2.2:      * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default.        (It is not stable enough yet.)      * Various bug fixes.      * A new experimental feature:        The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard        specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on        the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing        the contents of that directory.        Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you        will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the *        from being interpreted by your shell.        If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be        used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one        after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first        in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command        line or in the preferences file.)            Changes since 2.1:      * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain        Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync        protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a        small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs.        This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on        fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so        we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync        option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on.      * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers,        showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far.      * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be        have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is        incremented on every significant public release and the third        component is the ``patch level.''      * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface.      * The manual is now available in PDF format.      * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport        subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much        more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is        not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the        release version of Unison.        If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need        to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the        documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to        true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with        the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by        checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml        standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the        end.)            Changes since 1.292:      * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the        first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all        the files in both repositories).      * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail        after the client exits.      * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK        interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally).            Changes since 1.231:      * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See        the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions.      * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the        rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This        protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of        a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync        feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync        switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do:        you may not notice much speedup yet.)      * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem,        written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still        single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version,        you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.)        Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the        option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent        threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded        clients/servers can interoperate.      * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques        Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting        development effort to the GTK interface from now on.      * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The        modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk        instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you        must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in        c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure        to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by        default).      * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use        unison- instead of just unison as the remote        server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist        conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the        client, the same version will be selected on the server.            Changes since 1.219:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including:           + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not             working.           + umask is now ignored when creating directories           + directories are create writable, so that a read-only             directory and its contents can be propagated.           + Handling of warnings generated by the server.           + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both             sides is now flagged as erroneous.           + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant             roots.                o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated                  onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the                  link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself,                  which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the                  link is completely invisible)                o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root                  on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not                  calculate the working directory into which to write                  changes. This should be fixed.      * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive        files.      * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond        better.      * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going        back to previous items)      * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be        easier to find / download things now.            Changes since 1.200:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows.      * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the        same time as the replicas are being changed by the user.      * Internal performance improvements.            Changes since 1.190:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the        amount of memory allocation, especially during the first        synchronization. This should help power users with very big        replicas.      * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in        preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later        release.      * Miscellaneous bug fixes.            Changes since 1.180:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you        synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious        conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.      * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns.      * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from        working correctly when click-started.      * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were        causing spurious reports of different permissions when        synchronizing between windows and unix systems.      * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which        was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large        replicas.            Changes since 1.169:      * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files.      * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing        functions. Some power users have reported success with very large        replicas.      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored        automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an        appropriate ignore pattern in your profile.      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has        changed. Instead of putting a line of the form                  ignore =         in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put:                  ignore = Regexp         Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized:                  ignore = Name         matches any path in which one component matches , while                  ignore = Path         matches exactly the path .        Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in  and        :           + a ? matches any single character except /           + a * matches any sequence of characters not including /           + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }           + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.        See the user manual for some examples.            Changes since 1.146:      * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge        directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list        processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please        give it a try and let us know.      * Major additions to the documentation.            Changes since 1.142:      * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes.      * Major additions to the user manual.      * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt        automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots        to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical        UI from a desktop icon.      * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such        signal' exception.            Changes since 1.139:      * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled        with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not        to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've        heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using        precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade.      * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of        various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module        XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything.      * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such        signal' exception.            Changes since 1.111:      * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files        in the .unison directory have changed. In particular:           + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf           + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into             default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should             become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf.      * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the        manual for details.      * You can now have different preference files in your .unison        directory. If you start unison like this              unison profilename        (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the        file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of        default.prf.      * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface      * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server        process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using        sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created        using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server        is left running.)      * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server        started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This        may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode        server has finished initalization.)      * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development        tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack        around with.      * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make        Unison better.

Maybe we can lower FPs a bit more.  :-) I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can  achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't  factored in to the GA scores. The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of  doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we  really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as  time goes on. The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be  better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the  2.41 or 2.50 branches.

The  issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of  human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous  and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and  liable to be forged to generate FNs.

Another theory is that Europe was a rural backyard until the Renaissance,
certainly when compared to big urban centres like Constantinople and Baghdad.

I don't know the genetic studies of which you speak, but I know of one that
is sort-of relevant: apparently men of Ashkenazi descent are susceptible
to sickle-cell anemia and the probable reason is that the same genetic
factor that causes that also protects women from tuberculosis (IIRC), which
would have come in handy in central European towns at a time when the Jewish
population was a lot more urbanised than average Joes.

Date: Not supplied

After discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
""Hackers"" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 

    I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. ""The FBI wouldn't 
    waste resources on that,"" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. Becauseand this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumblingwhen you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygenand arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

Frenchman, American, and Russian get to talking bout which country has the 
more desireable women. Frenchman says, ""Ah, when a Frenchman puts his hands 
around zee waist of his lover, his fingers form a complete circle and 
touch--not because his hands are so large, but because zee  French woman's

    American says ""Yep, but when an American woman gets on a horse, her heels

are short, but because American women have such endlessly long, sexy legs.""
    Russian says: ""Da, but when a Russian slaps his wife's ass on his way out

You could also change your e-mail to a more responsible provider. If Eircom
are not up to scratch, then use somebody else and make sure you let Eircom
know why you think they are so useless. You can still keep your old e-mail
address if you have to.

To suggest that ISP's should not protect themselves against incompotent
configurations would effectively be a vote in support of SPAM.

Date: Not supplied

Jakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: ""To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" 

Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. 

What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.

FWIW, I would now recommend doing this (using a user with a procmailrc)
instead of a system alias; more secure, and easier to filter out crud
like bounces, virii etc. that render a corpus dirty.

My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of 
identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.

I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration.

BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with 
gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would 
use.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?

Thanks.

An example:  Being able to model RF propagation in three dimensions for a metro area when deploying wireless networks.  By having every single tree and building detail and similar, you can ""see"" even tiny dead spots due to physical blockage and signal attenuation.  Overlay this with fiber map data for yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which is also useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modeling existing network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further deployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.  Take that and tie it into a slick geo-physically aware real-time network monitoring and management system and you've really got something... For many applications though, 5-meter data is probably adequate. -James Rogers  jamesr@best.com",0,0

""MIAMI, Sept. 10 -- A two-gram rock of crack
cocaine was found inside the shoe of Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush's 25-year-old daughter by workers
at the central Florida rehabilitation center
where she is undergoing court-ordered drug

Noelle Bush was not arrested because witnesses
would not give sworn statements, but the

Wow, the witnesses would not nark of a Bush girl in an era where there are

Welcome to this week's edition of DivX News, your weekly fix of   information about what's hot and what's cool in the world of   DivX video.   (You are being sent this email because you subscribed to this   newsletter at DivX.com. If you'd like to unsubscribe, follow   the instructions at the end of this message.)   In This Week's Issue   --------------------   1. Classic Battle of the Planets in DivX Video   2. Warcraft III with DivX Video Sells like Hotcakes   3. Skins, Skins and More Skins      Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!   ------------------------------------      One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened   up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may   not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult   movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers   and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great   way to get their content in front of new audiences.      A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking   animated series ""Battle of the Planets"" from Sandy Frank   Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late   1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was   one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The   series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic   adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from   invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and   anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the   subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout   the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of   the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode   ""Mammoth Shark Menace"" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase,   and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets   episodes to come. * Watch ""Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace"" in the   DivX Showcase:      Warcraft III Sets Sales Records   -------------------------------   A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game   ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" from Blizzard Entertainment would   feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July,   Blizzard released ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" with   record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to   retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to   more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite   games in the near future.... * Watch the ""Warcraft III"" Trailer in High-quality DivX Video:    * Read more about the successful launch:         The Latest DivX Player Skins   ----------------------------   Let's face it--if you don't have the latest Player skins, you're   just not cool.    * DisPlayer: A sleek, stylish full-screen skin that will give you   the home theatre experience on your PC. Submitted by ""DIVX   Budman.""       * Coldfusion: A futuristic skin design dripping in coolness.

I thought this nekkid URL was going to be about the
infringement of 1st amendment rights for broadcasters
and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them
from making money on advertisements that are deemed
thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary
government board.  As it was posted to ""discussion"" I
thought there'd be some.

Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill
lamenting the fact that some people know how to
fill out a permit so that they can take advantage
of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously
he's poking fun at the idea that specific groups
get specific ""zones"" and that it's not up to the
police to decide what messages and signs get put into
what zones to most expediently keep order.  

The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
political rallies that you don't agree with has become
common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled
that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.
They teach you that your very first year of law school.

I think that given the information as laid out by the story,
Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free
speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost 
every American seems to involve the ability to communicate
an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing
a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience
that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical 
effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. 

I think Bill Neel of Butler needs to go back to school
as obviously he must have been sleeping in his civics
class or else they didn't teach civics in mini-guantanamo, OH
65 years ago.

Brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the X
model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
was how I read it. ;)

I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.

My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
confusion is, frankly.

When you boot from the WNT/W2k/whatever install CD, it offers you the
choice of installing a new system, or repairing an existing
installation.

Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek sculptor behind the plan, judged that the
 limestone of Mount Kerdylio, 70 miles east of Salonika and not far from the
 Mount Athos monastic community, was ideal for the patriotic sculpture. 
 
 As well as Alexander's granite features, 240 ft high and 170 ft wide, a
 museum, a restored amphitheatre and car park for admiring crowds are
planned
---------------------
So is this mountain limestone or granite?
If it's limestone, it'll weather pretty fast.

there was a copy of Doom 1 that came free with RedHat 5.2 - 
unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be on the newer CDs.

get the last laugh by going in, and saying that ID soft actually 
released a Linux wrapper for the game. you need to buy the CDs, though, 
then download the free wrapper.

Whoops. You should change that to: ... are always candidates for predictive or preventive delay. ACKs are delayed (per flow) in such a way that WAN-bound traffic reaching the edge router's Ethernet interface does not exceed WAN link speed (NO ROUTER QUEUES!). It does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive. It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow basis) to accommodate WAN link speed limit and current network utilization, rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds, eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed threshold (90%?). Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. Ever heard of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? Queueing packets after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it? Re: IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic It obviously cannot dissect IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic: it sees the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the LAN side (VPN gateway and router are two separate devices, PS between them). If the router does the tunneling, then the PS sees clear traffic. Typically, in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and the second at branch offices. The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the tunnel whereas the unit at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends. UDP and asymmetrical TCP (where the PS and router only see the outgoing packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station on the LAN) are handled differently. For asymmetrical TCP, it will time the release of packets to the receiving device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the receiving host. This informs the sender's TCP/IP stack that it should slow the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available. For UDP, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. It selectively drops only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion, which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts. ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped. >_Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on > the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that. The real gain is manageability and control. A LAN host only knows about the state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its TCP/IP stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the WAN is congested. A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts' TCP/IP stacks of the ""speed limit to obey"" for every connection (based on policies and network conditions), avoiding congestion. Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may not be as ""tight"" as for symmetrical TCP, but it does work. Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. If there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second.

Umm, don't get me wrong here, but I think you've been fed a less-than- accurate sales pitch. Let's ponder this for a minute. The device works by delaying ACKs... that is: packets with the ACK flag set, right? ... [letting this sink in for a while] ... Yes, all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set. So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded? Whoops. Okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed, but that the ACK sequence numbers or TCP window size fields are re-written (dicey). All you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from the traffic shaper to the endpoints. You still get L7-to-L7 delays. Big deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. Also, convincing endpoints to do delays probably results in less-than-perfect shaping since stack retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather than having the shaper itself do it; the shaper knows exactly when there is bandwidth available. But this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like UDP or ICMP. Or, for that matter, IPsec/GRE/whatever tunneled traffic. Neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can manipulate. So, I'm forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major way, or that your explanation/the explanation that you have been given of it is wrong. (Sorry.) What I think happens is that the delay is <=2msec as long as traffic limits aren't exceeded. This is reasonable. BUT when traffic exceeds the limits, things will begin to be queued. Now, with a well-behaved TCP stack, this _will_ mean that it will fall back to lower transmission rates; this is how TCP was designed, so that part isn't all wrong. And, again, this kind of shaping isn't rocket science. That is not to say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb (always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the queue), but, well, I just can't see that you can get any smarter than queueing when limits are actually exceeded.  _Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.

You're missing the NEW state. The initial SYN packet will not match with either of the first two rules. It should match the third if it's inbound, though. > So far, I am unable to show that it's working correctly...

You need to insert those logging rules above any ACCEPT, REJECT or DENY rules for them to be of any use. Are you sure the packets are hitting the box at all? Try moving the log rules to the top of the FORWARD chain, introduce logging rules to the PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, INPUT and OUTPUT chains, and/or use tcpdump as well to see where the packets are travelling.

You seem to be saying that whitelists are useless, because there are worms
which can compromise your system, read your address book/whitelist, and
sent themselves on, compromising a nonnegligible fraction of systems as
they go along. 

While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don't think this is
true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as
vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken
default settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes
for very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and 
stop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure 
alternatives, whatever comes first).

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause

Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt

Ananova:

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.



Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers"".



Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.

In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.

But no-one reported anything to the police.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.

In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.

Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.

No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.

Best personal regards,

MRS MARIAM ABACHA.

FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert into apt and let loose... :) Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The updates. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list",0,1

That reminds me of a Robin William's routine from the 80's concerning his 
witnessing of the birth of his son (back in the day, the presence of dad 
on the OB floor was still, well, rather Marin-ish).

 But the PROMs are for specific network cards, and all their are really is
a bootp/tftp client. Not the whole set of nice bits & pieces you get with
an OpenBoot PROM.

 AMD were talking of supporting it ages back, when the Athlon was looking
like it would just be on workstations from day one. They seemed to drop
it, and go for the crappy MSDOS compatible BIOS though.

Subject: Re: Al Qaeda's Fantasy Ideology


Youre right of course - the attack was performed for its effect on
muslims, not for its effect on the US. By showing that it can be done,
they inspire others to follow in their path, or so they hope.

I take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy, because it
is somewhat perjorative. Imagining different worlds can often lead the
world to become more like that imagined. Moreso if action is taken on
the basis of those imaginings.

Theres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that
anyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck.
This is equally a fantasy, but one made to approach reality through
consensus.

An interesting question then becomes, if Al Queda's actions are in
furtherance of a fantasy, what fantasies are George Bush's actions in
furtherace of? How many of the actions of George Bush and the US are
performed for their effect on the US population? For example, how much
showmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street. Is
this not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices Al Queda made?

What cultural myopia is in play here in the US?

I make a point of reading Australian, Britsish and US news. Today I
noticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqi
overtures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi war
preparations (digging bunkers etc).

At a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation on
multiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisible
preferably) is somewhat appealing. A self fullfilling prophesy, if you
like. Perhaps that's whats at work here.

Hi All,

Just wondering if anyone has ever installed StarOffice
6.0 (or Open Office), and if any have experienced any
problems with the install freezing ?

I'm using RedHat 7.3 kernel 2.4.18-3, and glibc 2.2.5
?

I might try downloading OpenOffice instead if it is
unresolved!!!!

Cheers all,

Colin

It may be a conspiracy against spell checkers. I noticed the Spell icon 
was dimmed in Netscape Communicator 4.79 about a month ago. It worked

more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in
family packs etc. but yes, the usual rules apply as MMS phones have network
efx.

content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful' content
is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users
communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send
half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.

display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone
know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?

misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant
had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera,
and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.

ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped
just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..

You're right. Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last
night (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, ""boy, that's dumb.""
If I wanted to share pictures with someone, I'd email them to them,
where they could see them on a 1024x or 1600x display, instead of

Remote realtime streaming video is neat, but sharing pictures? You invoke

Who's the real monster?


It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.

Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.

Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.

The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?

Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.

Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand


It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.

What Dave does is just the opposite.

Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.

One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  ""It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.""

Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.

We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.

If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it
along to zaphod@egroups.com

Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...


The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.

Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:

His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.

In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot...""

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?


It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.

Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!

The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!

Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!

Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?

Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark ""RSS""


Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.

So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:

http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336

This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.

Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!

Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:

Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them.

The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger against ragheads, thus: Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political opponents. Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I'm hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people: She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly missed. The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset about the death of a complete stranger. Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately transparent: Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling him ""the most honest man it has been my privilege to know"". And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within it complete immunity from prosecution: Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling and obnoxious behaviour. The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the effect on the reader could be catastrophic: In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme, Stephen Byers noted: ""She was everybody's favourite grandmother who touched the lives of billions.

*Q AND A SECTION*

*SHIVER MY TIMBERS*

/From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
my timbers/ originated?""

This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors' usage.

It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
Shiver my timbers if I do"".

It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board,

> No, as of oh, about a year to a year and a half ago

Let's limit the discussion to x86, to simplify.  There are some
additional complications for some of the other architectures.
(Essentially, they make most of the other architectures' ISO images
available gratis, because they aren't selling boxed sets and want the
public to have them anyway.  The ISOs include third-party proprietary
apps, but of necessity not the highly-restricted ones available in 
boxed set editions.)

(1) You can get a single-disk ISO9660 image of SuSE ""evaluation""
edition, version 7.0, _lots_ of places, including here:

ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/evaluation-7.0/evaluation-7.0.iso

(2) You could ""wget -r"" (or equivalent) the entire 8.0 FTP Edition (for
lack of an official name for it) from here (or mirror sites):

ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/

Please note the restricted rights granted for use of the SuSE-originated
YaST program specifically, stated here:

ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/COPYRIGHT.yast

A grant of limited redistribution rights to the distribution as a whole 
(apparently covering the FTP Edition and the Evaluation Edition) is
stated here: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/README.mirror-policy   Quoting:

     please make sure that you meet the following conditions if
     you intend to mirror ftp.suse.com:

   - SuSE Linux (YaST in particular) may not be reproduced on
     CDs or other media FOR VALUE. Reproduction for personal
     or educational use is explicitly allowed and encouraged.

> I'm not sure on the details of it, but I think SuSE have
> probably done an OpenBSD of the cd they sell?

OpenBSD Foundation assert a compilation copyright over the OpenBSD
official ISO9660 image.  A compilation copyright is the copyright
monopoly that, for example, the editor of a set of third-party short
stories receives.  Even though he didn't write any of the constituent
stories, he put creative work into selecting, arranging, and editing
those stories.  The law recognises such efforts as creative works
deserving copyright protection, if there is sufficient creative effort.
(A judge would decide, if someone made a court case of it.)  Courts have
held, on the other hand, that arrangement and publication of
alphabetical telephone listings in a ""yellow pages"" telephone directory
(the advertising section) don't have anywhere near enough creative
content to support an overreaching telco's claim of compilation
copyright.  (The court politely said ""Nice try"", in effect.)

The OpenBSD Foundation's claim may be a bit of a legal bluff, too.
Theoretically, one could get around it by creating a slightly different
set of ISO9660 images, thereby finessing the claim of compilation
copyright.  But nobody bothers, because OpenBSD Foundation actually 
charges only a very reasonable price for jewel-case sets, and nobody
wants to endure the barrage of hatemail from Theo & co.

I've never seen any claim from SuSE of compilation copyright on its ISOs
or distribution as a whole.

> I could be wrong, I don't use SuSE so haven't investigated,
> but essentially the only 'free' version of SuSE will be it's
> ftp offering.

Again, the ""FTP Edition"" and the Evaluation Edition may be redistributed
more-or-less freely, as long as it's not ""for value"".  (Ditto the
""live-eval"" edition, which is a demo only.)  The three boxed sets'
contents may not.

No that is appropriate content for the file.  I'm not a C programmer, but I think that these sort of things (#include ) are instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions e.g. ""#include "" gives you maths type functions.  Since they start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation. Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source.  I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag     --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4 which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this is the right way to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversions.h & Co. I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h) files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files don't really belong there). For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful compilation. m >  > Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed > that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h > file.

The less expensive  models will suit students or home users who need to print letters  or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks.  In pricier models, vendors typically add more RAM, higher-capacity  paper trays, duplexing capabilities, and networking options for  corporate and small-business users.

Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
tutorials in the ibm developer connection.

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1

and

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2

Registration is needed.

I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
suggested by someone.

For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).

I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
implementation at anytime.

Thank you again!

Mario Torre

THE POWERMAN 10 MILLION - TRY BEFORE YOU BUY THE POWERMAN 10 MILLION, is the  ABSOLUTE BEST product of its kind anywhere in the world today.

No one... and we mean NO ONE is shipping valuable CDs to customers before  they pay. What is different about this offering? The main difference is all you have to do is email us  the address to ship the CD to! You don't have to worry about getting ripped off. There is no risk to you. Test The CD, when you're 100% satisfied that the CD is everything and more than it claims to be -  then send $49.95 by check. money order or credit card. Our claim to fame, is that our addresses are deliverable!  The number #1 problem with email lists are  deliverability. You may have seen dozens of ads for lists or CD's or you may have purchased a list in  the past. Chances are, the list was produced 6 months, 1 year or even two years ago! Not ours, a new  volume CD comes out every 6-7 weeks.  Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists: 1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates.  2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even more. No address with inappropriate or  profane wording survive!  3. Then, a special filter file is used to eliminate the ""Web Poisoned"" e-mail addresses from the list. Our EXCLUSIVE system reduced these ""poison"" addresses to near zero. You may have seen CD's with 30, 40,  50 million addresses, not only do they contain many undeliverable addresses, but most are notorious for  millions of these ""poisoned"" email addresses. 4. Next we used our private database of thousands of known ""extremists"" and kicked off every one we could  find. NOTE:We maintain the world's largest list of individuals and groups that are opposed to any kind of  commercial e-marketing... they are gone, nuked! 5. All domains have been verified as valid.

Down the line it can lead to suspicions  based not on significant clues but upon things such as ""fails to display  sufficient respect for authority"", ""laughs whenever the phrase 'homeland  security' is used"", and ""hangs out with anti-social misfits.""

The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will  have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany  through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum  of 4 per cent of Americans to report ""suspicious activity"". Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier  this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale  investigations of US citizens. As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war  against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project. Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are  being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to  homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees,  truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted recruits. A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov,  is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants  participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the  10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total  population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say ""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could... [Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of *those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.] The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a ""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the best school possible. Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard, for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the years for proof. Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course, Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades, and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in. The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is* smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow. BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*. There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort. [I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you, apparently.] BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition, most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as Santa Claus come election time... In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise. To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
the docs for (n)mh for all the details.

There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).

And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...

This is something that often annoys me. Programmers can spend hours inlining code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance. The best performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm. Most function calls get made very rarely. Optimising them often makes no sense, produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms. Inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small - such as string manipulation routines. But these are a small part of most applications. One example I frequently see is people optimising a database function call. Most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of instruction cycles. Trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost saving of, say, 5 seconds in 20 hours. But a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline optimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes. - Matthew (who really should be writing code) __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

---------------------------------------------------------------------=20
=20
  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex,=20
Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy.=20
=20
Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the=20
UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the=20
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer =
-=20
known locally as The English Season.=20

Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our=20
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these=
=20
events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport.=
=20


  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication=20
tool?

Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the=
=20
brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where=20
the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We=20
believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?

We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of=20
the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and=20
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and=20
development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to=20
make The Season central to our marketing mix.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?

We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our=20
mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the=
=20
frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and=20
the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever=20
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.

We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions=20
related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office wil=
l=20
like to be involved in such a decision.=20


  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?

Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment=20
decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events.=20
This is our rule and frame of investment.


  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?

Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-=E0=
-
vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press,=20
magazine of all kinds).=20

Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that=20
complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of=
=20
similar status, but differing interests.=20


  Please describe one of your sponsorships

The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdra=
y=20
Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by=
=20
Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve=20
Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target=20
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the=
=20
king of sports.


  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?

Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large=20
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we=20
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve=20
Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are=20
getting a good return on our investment.


  How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?

You can just recompile the apt source RPM, if it's the newer one. (Such as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones. Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box. (Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production boxes). Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a directory containing both ""new"" and ""old"" RPMS?

The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/ today for more info.
 
Register your domain name today for just $14.95 at: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/  Registration fees include full access to an easy-to-use control panel to manage your domain name in the future.

Siberia Bound is a coming-of-age account of life as an entrepreneur in a 
new wild-and-free-market Russia of the early 1990s. Alexander Blakely 
uses his gift for storytelling to describe the four years he spent 
living and working toward the American dream in the former Soviet Union.

'Siberia Bound: Chasing the American Dream on Russia's Wild Frontier' by 
Alexander Blakely

Reviewed by David Tuller
Sunday, August 18, 2002; Page BW08


SIBERIA BOUND
Chasing the American Dream On Russia's Wild Frontier
By Alexander Blakely
Sourcebooks. 320 pp. $22.95

Judging from Siberia Bound, Alexander Blakely seems like a pretty cool 
guy -- adventurous, engaging and fun to hang out with. After all, most 
chroniclers of Russian life base their tales in Moscow or, alternately, 
St. Petersburg, the most livable of Russia's not-very-livable cities. 
Deciding instead to settle in a former academic community outside of 
Novosibirsk, one of Siberia's major cities, Blakely set out to pursue, 
as his book's subtitle declares, ""the American dream on Russia's wild 
frontier.""

Blakely, who moved to Siberia after finishing college with an economics 
degree, has a breezy writing style. And although his book is flawed in 
many respects, it does include some sharp observations of life in 
Russia. ""Usually with construction,"" he tells us, for instance, ""you 
have two choices: 1) you can do it quickly, or 2) you can do it right. 
The Soviet construction worker . . . takes his time doing things wrong.""

Anyone who has spent time in Siberia knows that its inhabitants are a 
breed apart. They disdain their compatriots in the country's Western 
regions and pride themselves -- perhaps excessively -- on their courage, 
strength and inner fortitude. Siberia, in fact, occupies a space in the 
Russian national psyche similar to that of the Wild West in American 
mythology. The efforts throughout the 16th and 17th centuries to settle 
Siberia's vast expanse and exploit its natural resources still resonate 
with Russians. So does the region's role as a convenient dumping ground 
for criminals and political dissidents during the czarist centuries and 
as home to the cruel network of gulags in Soviet times.

Unfortunately, little of this rich brew of history and myth makes an 
appearance in Siberia Bound. Neither do lots of other pertinent facts. 
Russians often say that, in Russia, anything can happen -- and usually 
does. So it's easy to believe that two young men could establish a 
chocolate business on little more than hope, smarts and chutzpah. But 
while Blakely describes establishing a cocoa-bean importing business 
with his friend Sasha, we never learn how they met in the first place or 
why he believes Sasha to be a trustworthy associate. The two of them 
strike a deal to sell their beans to a local chocolate factory, yet we 
find out virtually nothing about the chocolate the factory produces. Is 
it tasty? Disgusting? Are we talking chocolate bars, chocolate truffles 
or chocolate syrup? A few details would go a long way here.

The author has the makings of a terrific story. But even though Siberia 
Bound includes frequent humorous episodes, Blakely generally fails to 
transform the pungent ingredients into a satisfying meal. The constant 
descriptions of encounters and conversations ultimately differ little 
from one another. People are forever winking, smirking and slapping one 
another on the back. Slamming down shots of vodka and making sentimental 
toasts to women and friendship play an inevitable role in any account of 
Russian life, but reading about such occasions becomes tiresome after 
the 20th or 30th repetition.

Blakely is also given to facile comments that are meant to sound smart 
but often fall flat. ""Democracy and the free market, the best 
institutions the West had to offer, stormed over the borders and ran 
deep into Russia,"" he tells us. ""But like all foreign armies throughout 
history, they quickly were spread too thin and became diluted."" And then 
there's this summation of his time in Russia: ""Those four years have 
left me with a lifetime of rabid ambivalence to chew on until I've got 
no teeth left.""

Blakely manages to include a few unpleasant -- and wholly unnecessary -- 
laughs at the expense of Chinese workers and gays. And although I like 
wordplay as much as the next guy, it's jarring when non-English-speaking 
characters make puns in English. ""In a pinch,"" says one character, a 
chocolate factory director who warns Blakely not to store extra cocoa 
beans on site, ""I'm afraid we would probably take a pinch.""

Some of these faults wouldn't matter if Siberia Bound were a picaresque 
novel or an account that didn't aspire to authenticity. But the effect 
here is to undermine a reader's faith in the narrator's reliability and 
to reduce most of the characters to the stock figures encountered in 
dozens of other accounts of Russian life. So in the end, I believed the 
broad contours of Blakely's story but found it hard to take seriously 
many of the particulars. And his ultimate conclusion -- that capitalism, 
material comfort and wealth do not bring happiness -- hardly qualifies 
as a revelation.

###  **You only _THINK you're a U.S. citizen!!

If you were born in Washington D.C., Puerto Rico,  
Guam, the Virgin Islands or some other U.S.  
possession; you're right and I'm wrong.

_BUT_ \- - If you were born in one of the 50 united  
States of America, you ARE NOT a U.S. citizen.  
Rather, you are a Citizen  of Idaho, Ohio, Maine,  
etc.; the state of the Union in which you were __BORN!__

This simple reality holds serious benefits for you!

Since you ARE NOT a ""federal"" citizen, you owe  
__NO federal income taxes__. The IRS can only demand  
income tax payments from _3 kinds of citizens:_

1\. Those who are citizens of the U.S.!  
2\. Anyone who receives ""income"" from a U.S. source  
(and wait until you find out what ""income"" really is!).  
3\. Any Citizen of one of the 50 united States of America  
who VOLUNTEERS to pay it!

Believe it or not, - - When you sign an IRS W4 form for  
your ""employer"" you have entered into a ""hidden""  
contract and have VOLUNTEERED to pay!

Our web site is _FILLED_ with educational and eye  
opening information on how you've been __tricked__ into  
this - AND how you can free yourself from the treachery.

That's simple.  The same thing that any beta project needs to improve.
Continuous
End-User testing, constructive feedback, and suggestions on how to improve
the
system.  Upgrade each time a new beta version comes out, so everyone is
testing
on the same version of the code, and old bugs don't get reported as being in
the
new version, thus slowing down the debugging process.

Report any installation issues, bugs, errors, etc., to the V2 beta list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-testers) so that they can
be quickly
looked at, etc.  Provide detailed description of issues, include logs if
possible,
as well as any ""captured"" spam that generated the error(s).


Thank you, please drive through,

the dated address that my from appears as is a good address for five days
for anyone.  after that it requires a confirm message from the sender.
my regular email address requires a confirm address if i haven't
explicitly given permission to the sender.

and yes, spammers could try to set up a system to reply to my confirm
messages, but that would require them to a) give out a valid email address
in their From headers, and b) use a lot more bandwidth then they do now
(thereby costing them more money).

oh, and they can't forge confirm messages.  the confirm message system
works something like this:

    message goes in the pending q and is assigned an id.
    that id is encrypted and used to create the from address of the
	outgoing confirm mail - kevin+confirm+kghdsfg@ie.suberic.net
    only a message to that address will work to free the message from
	the q (or i can free it using tmda-pending).

all of this is discussed on http://tmda.sf.net/

No, rather a new breakthrough in ballistic snake oil delivery. So it's
built into a walkthrough gate, and is noninvasive. It's supposed to
analyse brain and heart activity. While you can pick up heartbeat by
Doppler radar, later tells it's realtime DSP on an array of SQIDs. Later
they mention they use passive IR imaging and eye saccade evaluation. Maybe
they're also doing a Kirlian reading, and recording your mana flux, too.
(Conclusive evaluation by entrail reading is nonoptional only for
confirmed terrorists).

So they claim terrorist intent translates in biosignatures they can pick
up by close-distance passive telemetry, in realtime, with a very low
number of false positives, while having no chance to calibrate, in the
field.

Right.

Seems somebody is so awfully eager to pick up a slice of research grant
pie from the heimatland securitate money they haven't even bothered to 
invent a plausible lie.

I wouldn't make that assumption.  I'd assume that rewrite_subject was on,

Do you know why?  The strangest implied claim there is that it hates MIME independent of HTML.  For example, the spamprob of 'content-type:text/plain' in that pickle is under 0.21.  'content-type:multipart/alternative' gets 0.93, but that's not a killer clue, and one bit of good content will more than cancel it out. WRT hating HTML, possibilities include: 1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML. 2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part),    so that the tags aren't getting stripped.  The pickled classifier    despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage. 3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the    latter doesn't contain the same text as the text/html part (for    example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just    says something like ""This is an HMTL message.""). If it's #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize() meaning ""even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway"".  In fact, I'd like to do that and default it to True.

Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things that I never saw happen).

I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally. If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.   Cheers, -James Rogers  jamesr@best.com",0,1

From: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC.


Sir/Madam;

This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
distribution.
  
We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
Applications Monitor) capability.
The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
applications as you
have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
MAM capability expands third party application ""control"" of a Watchdog as
access to the application's
source code is no longer needed.

Here is how it all works:
Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
executable program that they wish for monitoring.

A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
continuous operation.

It's that simple!

Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
Watchdogs.

Watchdog Control Center Features:
- Automated installation
- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
- User selectable Watchdog timeout period
- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
- Multiple Application Monitoring

Included on the Installation CD:
- Watchdog Control Center
- Watchdog Drivers
- Documentation

"""AB Sanni"" <babsanni@maktoob.com>",<lynn.dietz@midrange.com>,"Sun, 21 Jul 2002 15:37:30 -0700",,"20th July, 2002

To:    The President

From:  AB Sanni

Assalam Aleikum,

I wish to seek your assistance in a matter that needs trust secrecy and
confidentiality.

I am A. B. Sanni, a close confidant to Mohammed Abacha, son of late
General Sani Abacha, former head of state Federal Republic of Nigeria, who
ruled from November 17th 1993 to June 8th 1998 when he died suddenly in
office.

Since then, the family as a whole has been facing all sorts of
harassments, by security operatives/agents of the new Head of State
(General Obasanjo) who served a jail term under my friend's father for
coup offence. Even my friend's old mother has been detained and tortured
many times.  Mohammed is now being charged for military decision of his
father's regime e.g. the murder cases of political opponents. These
offences he knows nothing about, as he was only the Head of State's son,
not even a military man nor was he in the government. 

His father ruled for five years during which period he acquired financial
gains and property all over the world from his share of Crude Oil Sales as
the Head of State. Now, the family has lost all assets (property and money
in Nigeria) to the new government. Ref. News Watch Magazine publication of
11th to 18th October, 1999. However, they have hidden records in a secret
name with the Nigerian Insurance Deposit Corporation to access a coded
trust accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million
United States Dollars only ($338,000,000).   Mohammed is currently being
detained and tortured to sign off accounts of his late father and he has
done that but not the coded trust accounts in the name of certain
government multinational contractors that I can not disclose now.

THE AIM OF THIS LETTER IS TO REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE TO SECURE THIS
ACCOUNT IN A SAFE/CONFIDENTIAL BANK AND HELP INVEST THE MONEY FOR OUR
MUTUAL BENEFIT. We also expect to use some of our share of the money to
relocate ourselves to another safe Country because right now Nigeria is
not safe and we will like to go into hiding overseas if we can escape.

If you are interested in helping secure the accounts please contact me
immediately by email ""a_sanni@email.com"", so that we can arrange an
initial meeting in a neighboring country, thus you can present your
investment program and projects for our assessment.  Thereafter we will
sign an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) binding this business
relationship and immediately entrust you to access the coded trust
accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million United
States Dollars only ($338,000,000).

We will depend on your business experience to make sure that we get
maximum returns on our investment with you.

PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING THE CODED TRUST ACCOUNT YOU
ARE LIKELY TO INCURE EXPENSES BUT IT WILL BE PAID BACK ONCE WE SECURE THE
DEPOSIT.  IT IS 100% SAFE FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. 
Just forward via email your full name, phone number, fax number and bank
details as the new beneficiary to enable us make formal application for
the transfer of ownership to you.

We look forward to your helping us, but if you are not interested kindly
discard this letter and still maintain its confidentiality.

Ma-Salam.

"""ContraComm International"" <istina007@yahoo.com>",List Member <ler@lerctr.org>,11 Sep 2002 08:33:28 -0000,SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica,"Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

--] Anyone heard of this law before?

Back when I was running the WSMF shoutcast server these restrictions were
just being placed on netcasters. Most folks laughed it off. Now with the
license fees its not laughable anymore. If you pay the fee you are bound
to the restrictions, if you dont your running the criminal line.

I still run a stream up on live365. Its been playing the same 10 hour
block of Jean Shepard shows for the last year. I really should change them
up.

If I were going to do the old WSMF shoutcast now adays I would either
spend lots of time going over regulations to see what I can or cannot do
or I would just chuck the regs out and do what I want. Or I might write
some apps to stay in regs ..I dont know..one thing is for sure it
defiently takes the spontaneous edge off things:)-

I've received an _incredibly kind invitation_; I sure hope I can take it! I 
feel sort of bad though, because I think other people deserve it more than I 
do. 

Hm, the next few weeks are pretty crazy: 

*Thu 26:* Edward Tufte Course[1] and MSI[2] member's night, Chicago.
*Fri 27:* OSCOM[3], Berkeley. Bookmobile launch[4], SF. _(Unlikely to attend.)_
*SatSun:* Hoshana Rabba, Shemini Atzeret, Simchat Torah. _(Jewish Holidays)_
*30-Oct3:* OSXCON[5], Santa Clara. _(Need someplace to stay. Anyone?)_
*Mon 7:* Bernstein's oral argument in crypto export case[6], San Francisco. _
(Ditto.)_
*Tues 8:* Bookmobile[7] arrives in D.C.
*Wed 9:* Lessig's oral argument in Eldred case[8], D.C.

This is called ""pseudo-packages"" or ""meta-packages"" and Debian has been using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty packages. Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like them. For me it's more of an ugly ""hack"" than anything else, and I'd approve completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire categories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages. Also, you can trivially do ""apt-get install "", but removing all that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a trivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.

I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of going
down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges
cost more than the printer itself! I know how you feel
- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is
a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has got
to stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companies
anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!
Well, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Gosh darn, not another
cheap knockoff printer cartridge!"" Like you, I was very 
skeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate
said it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. 
So I tried it. I mean, there was nothing to lose because they
offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty
on all of their products and FREE Shipping on ALL orders!
Let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
Period. Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you,
I've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies
to Now ONLY $475! and I haven't had to sacrifice the quality or
service that I received from the local office supply store. In fact,
the service is even BETTER!  I've had 1 defective cartridge since 
I started dealing with SUPERINK and they sent me a new replacement
within 3 days, no questions asked. Now, I can print all I want!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted their manufacturer
and got permission to be a reseller - at a BIG discount. I want
to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies
like I did. Because a penny saved is a penny earned! 
I give you my personal pledge the SUPERINK soltuion will absolutely
WORK FOR YOU. If it doesn't, you can return your order anytime
for a full refund.  

If you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the
printer companies, or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges,
then I recommend - the SUPERINK solution.

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how do we save all this money
without losing quality and service?""

Modern technology has provided SUPERINK with unique, revolutionary
methods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to 'settle', which
prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and
handling. Nothing ""magic"" about it - just quality & savings, BIG SAVINGS!

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you save 30%-70% per week/per month/per year or per lifetime 
by purchasing any of our ink & toner supplies. Just try it once, you'll 
keep coming back - there's nothing to lose, and much MONEY to be saved! 
100% Satisfaction Guaranteed. You will be able to print as much as you
want without wasting money or sacrificing quality - GUARANTEED.
That is my pledge to you.

tim.one@comcast.net (Tim Peters),,"Sun, 08 Sep 2002 15:48:13 -0400",[Spambayes] testing results,"Neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each.
We're missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed);
the ""before custom fiddling"" figures on the 3 reported runs were:

    false positive percentages
        0.187
        0.749
        0.780
    total unique fp 19

    false negative percentages
        2.072
        2.448
        0.574
    total unique fn 43

The ""total unique"" figures counts all 6 runs; it's just the individual-run
fp and fn percentages we're missing for 3 runs.

Jeremy reported these ""before custom fiddling"" figures on 4 sets with about
600 ham and spam in each:

    false positive percentages
        0.000
        1.398
        1.398
        0.000
        1.242
        1.242
        1.398
        1.398
        0.000
        1.553
        1.553
        0.000
    total unique fp 139

    false negative percentages
       10.413
        6.104
        5.027
        8.259
        2.873
        5.745
        5.206
        4.488
        9.336
        5.206
        5.027
        9.874
    total unique fn 970

So things are clearly working much better for Neil.  Both reported
significant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header
lines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's header
analysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completely
but added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all
header lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all
those starting with 'x-vm').

When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I
see:

    false positive percentages
        0.000
        0.000
        0.200
        0.000

        0.000
        0.200
        0.000
        0.200
        0.400
        0.000
        0.400
        0.200
        0.600
    total unique fp 10

    false negative percentages
        0.800
        0.400
        0.200
        0.600
        1.000
        0.000
        0.600
        1.200
        1.200
        0.800
        0.400
        0.800
        1.800
        0.800
        0.400
        1.000
        1.000
        0.400
        0.000
        0.600
    total unique fn 36

This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run
on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to
12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random
pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it's
not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.

It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If they
were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the
algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.",0,0

I think it's fine, in general, just so long as no-one checks in anything
that puts it into my test corpus.

Or alternately, whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer.

One of my favorite pieces of graffti that I have spotted was at UCI,

It has so many meanings, and so many of them are disturbing, especially

This is the only quote I could find relating to promiscuity in
homosexual men.

""I think people feel a certain invulnerability, especially young
people, like this disease doesn't affect me. The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, ""That isn't me. I'm not promiscuous."" Promiscuity, especially, was a piece where people could easily say, ""Well, I'm not. Promiscuous is more than I do."" If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me.""

You could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume.  BFD.
This kind of random generation of numbers that leads the nutty
religious bigots (as you mentioned earlier).

Grr.   Bits damnit.  Now, I must go brief.

 I've just been re-aquainted with the Jumpstart stuff after a long
absence.

 There is a nice need 'add_install_client' script that you feed the
archtecture, ethernet address & ip to, and it'll setup everything from
RARP to Bootparams for you. Very simple.

 This script takes a -d option, to boot via DHCP also. On the negative
side, Sun's terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won't work
properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation mode the
Wyse is trying to do.

 To do PC netbooting properly, you need an motherbard with a PXE BIOS.
Then you are flying.

 Heh, how hard would it be to get a PC with an OpenBoot prom ?

Yeah, I disabled the subject rewrite.  I also lowered required_hits 
to 1 (wonder if I can do zero) so that almost all mail is scored--I'm 
testing it right now.  auto_report_threshold was raised to 100 to

Ah, now I didn't notice this.  I rather like this option.  I may set

This makes sense.  I may do that for just this reason.  Thanks!

The procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that 
procmail doesn't expect.  Exactly what that something is, hasn't been
confirmed by anyone on the procmail list.  It might be exiting with a
nonzero status, or it might be producing output on the standard error,
or it might be something else entirely.

So Simon is attempting to get SA to run flawlessly, because then it can't
tickle the procmail bug.  This isn't a fix, it's a band-aid, but because
he apparently doesn't have the option of installing a newer procmail ...",0,0

  Based on your description the whole thing would be 1 part.

  If your mail contains a fwd of a mail *inline* with mime boundaries, 
  then your mail is all consindered to be just text.  If you fwd
  the mail as attachment, the attachment is considered to be a separate
  part  - but the attachment is not broken down further for

Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend

August 25, 2002
By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG 




 

It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when
he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways
last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner
and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and
renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped
through his files and found the number for the Texas
Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David
Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation
for fixing problem companies. 

Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,
had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of
$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed
for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600
million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in
America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. 

That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let
Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked
Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.
Siegel reached. 

In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days
before US Airways announced its plans to file for
bankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated
about $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas
Pacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to
kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep
the company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to
buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,
and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges
from bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a
better offer. 

""One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks
were,"" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in
an interview after the bankruptcy filing. ""There aren't
many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to
delve into the airline industry."" 

Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying
businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman
made their names during the recession of the early 1990's
with investments in Continental and America West. The
firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping
companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its
extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. 

Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last
year alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six
acquisitions, most in unloved industries like
semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,
it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been
losing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding
for Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. 

The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these
deals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of
MEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6
- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150
million bank loan. 

In the last few years, most firms that specialize in
leveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and
other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -
have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made
managements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are
for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. 

Texas Pacific is different. ""This is a terrific environment
for them,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the
Blackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. 

Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the
West, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: ""Most
other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.
You don't see many guys wanting to take on operational
fixes."" 

Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep
its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant
interviews and its Web site is perpetually under
construction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,
the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for
this article. 

Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and
bright, patterned socks. ""He likes argyle socks, and they
tend to fall down around his ankles,"" said Henry Miller, an
investment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in
his career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman
argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. 

When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known
for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking
in places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.
""Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on
my caller I.D., I know it's David calling,"" said one
investment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. 

Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the
chief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.
Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making
early bets in industries like cable television and taking
stakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,
which had been seized by the government. Over nearly a
decade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual
return of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. 

In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.
Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also
worked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with
Mr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &
Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. 

The three men have complementary skills, investment bankers
and other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master
strategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and
the detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price
often recruits managers and advises on operational issues. 

""David is very much the optimist, very much the deal
maker,"" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of
Continental. ""Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.
He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will
approach investments a little bit more skeptically than
David does."" 

By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well
established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion
from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To
celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San
Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a
party. 

But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific
hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no
deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate
blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but
stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the
businesses untenable. 

Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing
investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during
that stretch. 

""They started to cash out early in the cycle,"" said Mario
Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money
management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific
investors. 

The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas
Pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that
needed its help. 

But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the
rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health
maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the
mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new
managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a
$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian
motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than
quadrupled. 

But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at
the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million
investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for
which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,
has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of
Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand
for luxury goods. 

Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a
semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,
both of which filed for bankruptcy. 

Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's
performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in
two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The
first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and
including investments made through March 1997, should
return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific
investor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997
- could return less than half that, this investor
estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on
these investments before the stock market sank. 

But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings
in the second fund, profits on these investments could
rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new
management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the
economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, ""their
returns look pretty good when you consider that some other
funds won't return any capital"" to investors. 

But with the weak economy throwing many companies into
trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier
success, the investor said. ""They should do exceptionally
well,"" he said. 

Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It
relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure
troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except
for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it
replaces managers. 

Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,
for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his
old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it
to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. 

Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then
brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and
in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief
executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul
of the company and is now considered a great turnaround
artist of the industry. 

""The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob
Ferguson,"" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for
the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the
thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982
Braniff bankruptcy. ""He chose Bethune over his longtime
friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a
better job."" 

At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more
extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was
led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. 

W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.
Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of
chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.
Parker said the two men quickly realized they had ""somewhat
kindred spirits."" 

The board replaced most senior managers at America West,
except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped
down last September. His restructuring plan had made the
airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from
bankruptcy in August 1994. 

Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth
about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and
the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. 

""These are not passive investors, nor am I,"" said Donald L.
Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's
board with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. ""You're active.
Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake."" 

After overseeing managers who worked successfully with
unions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a
good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways
was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris
Chiames, a spokesman for the airline. 

Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would ""be as labor
friendly as possible,"" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can
still entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the
billionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed
interest. 

Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with
Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two
years of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the
chain's franchisees - even before the company, which had
been owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for
sale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National
Franchisee Association, which represents most Burger King
franchisees. 

""We liked what they had to say about the human component of
the businesses they buy,"" Mr. Josephson said. Many other
owners, he added, ""are dismissive of labor."" 

At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an
executive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John
Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,
who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest
bought out their stake in Continental in 1998. 

Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored
with the technology industry, despite the failure of so
many start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the
semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is
highly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. 

The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,
which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,
has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and
took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of
its stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger
investment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip
maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in
Asia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for
bankruptcy last year. 

Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third
company, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6
billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last
year. 

Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,
may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the
payment to E.On, based in Dsseldorf, Germany, was actually
more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal
said. 

Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company
of the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to
guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas
Pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of
which it swapped for more stock in the company. 

""They did a good job of timing the acquisition,"" said
Nabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted
that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit
since the fourth quarter of 2000. 

But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly
sizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America
West and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,
the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. 

Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount
ticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75
million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to
invest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.
Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as
Priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site
but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until
after the sale. 

The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt
Hotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that
the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific
remains committed to it. 

Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to
talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman
seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the
steep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,
Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,
Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet.

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.

No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.

Best personal regards,

We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed. With our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing Money Judgments. By following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of Money Judgments. The income potential is substantial in this profession. = We have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per year = . Some choose to = operateout of their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices. Today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates. Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies, police officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us for reports. Many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars. Legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10% interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments. Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to $500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the payment of the principal. Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per year. This is just for interest, not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income. Typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars. 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43% are women and 36% are part time . One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are working on will be there when you return. The Judgments are still in force, they do not disappear. The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you are. You are not a collection agency. Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing are as follows: Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who to write to) 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them unless you want to. You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and 50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00. You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you. They range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc. The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to 1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $25.00. Once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located. (Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course) When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to the original Judgment holder. Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of Judgment to the court. (Included in the course) Quote's from several of our students: Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars = .Your professionalism in both the manual and your support.   You have the video opened doors for me in the future.  There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states  he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on"" After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now = making $2,000.00 per week and = expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in judgments I am collecting on now"" After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated ""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I will have to hire someone to help out"" Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months"" >From the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following: With our course you can own your own successful business. A business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to retire on and travel the world. A business which is extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every day is new and exciting. None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen for many others already. Make it happen for you! If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation on your part. Please call us at = 1-281-500-4018. We have Service Support staff = available to you from 8:00am to 10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis number you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

Hi,

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
specially with regards to false-positives.

cheers,
vipul.

Michael Conry <michael.conry@ucd.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Sat, 10 Aug 2002 01:58:45 +0100",[ILUG] cdrecord + 2.4.19 = hard-lock,"Hi all,
I've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering
if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.

I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.
I have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the
scsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 until
probably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patch
and installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went to
burn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed
cdburning to work fine.

This problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).
the cdrecord command I was using was
    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso
The blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just
locks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,
the system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does
reboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages
/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).
cdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my
cdr drive and my cdrw).
The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.

I tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a
kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives
the same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source for
cdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was
wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used
which maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.

Anyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me much
good, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know is
a)  How to fix the problem ;-)
b)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity
    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm
    not very knowledgeable on these things.
c)  Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If
    this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond
    the guidelines on kernel.org)?

Like I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully
received.

_Kevin Fanning_: Hallmark vs. Successories[1]. &#8220;At Successories you were 
mostly left alone. There'd be brainstorm meetings to come up with new topics to 
tackle (""Howsabout 'Diligence'?"" ""No I think we did that one already, didn't 
we?"") but mostly you could just hang around, bang away at whatever ideas you 
had, show your manager what you were working on, and he/she'd give you 
feedback, encouragement, tell you to keep at it, point to the poster of 
Stick-to-it-iveness on their wall (Yes, we had our own brand of Successories 
posters hanging everywhere. I mean why not.) and give you the thumbs up.&#8221;

Million..._



**Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate**

The Wall Street Bulletin believes that the recent investment of capital into
Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, is further proof of the continued validity of
the telecommunication market when looked at from the perspective of the small
to mid-sized enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future
may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to
remain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. ""Every major
industry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar
transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the
mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert
Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.
Christopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all the people
that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving
carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few
millions."" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the
link at the end of this newsletter._

As we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)
has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As
InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this
company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.
This could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our
Highest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.



**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**

We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.
A similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),
share price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over
$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously
had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267
million.

IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for
potential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a
few months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an
increase of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time
is right for investors to get in on the ground floor.



**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**

InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-
sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet
is a prestigious ""Diamond"" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for
Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to
offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building
a communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer
bases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its
acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then
expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance
profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data
services and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and
this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten
years. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.

The IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com



**The __ IT Market**

Based on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag
significantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including
Internet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT
spending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7
percent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market
researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.
In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in
the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436
billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect
growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will
experience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market
will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,
India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_



**Particulars**

The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth
recommendation list for the following reasons:

1\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,
single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the
acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution
channel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,
wireless, and data.

  
2\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range
communities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the
value of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing
campus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic
Committee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.

  
3\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to
acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and
smaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the
targeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to
purchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.



**Investment Consideration**

InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,
2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1
2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for
their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and
more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to
small to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars.

That's the first thing they said to me...

""About your commissions, you might want to sit down..."". And then they told me
how big the check was and they were right, I was glad I took a seat because I
almost passed out.

My name is Matt Morrow and I've seen a lot of stuff over the years but nothing
like this...  The marketing system I've been using for the past 6 months to
create this virtual flood of cash is about to be released as the "" **Multiple
Income Stream Generator** "".  Let me assure you.... **you've never seen
anything like it**.  This marketing system is the easiest way for anyone to
make an additional income that can grow to...well, the sky's the limit!  

**YOUR SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT... ARE _ _YOU__ SITTING DOWN?**

The founders of the company have decided to open this system up on a
**LIMITED** Beta Tester level to prove that anyone can make money with this
system. I have made a special arrangement to allow **YOU** to be one of the
beta testers  

What does this mean for you?

An opportunity use this system before it is out of Beta Testing phase to make
an additional $50,000 - $250,000 per year.

This opportunity is 100% RISK-FREE for a limited time.

You will have a REAL opportunity to make a never-ending cash flow stream from
the comfort of your home, no matter what level of computer skills you now
possess.

**![](http://64.251.7.133/15185/IG_pic.jpg)NO SPECIAL SKILLS, NO EXPERIENCE IS
NECESSARY!**

I have determined this marketing system to be the easiest way for anyone to
make an additional income

Current members are making thousands every week!

If you are looking for a no-brainer solution to making an additional $50,000
\- $250,000 per year, this is your ticket, if you qualify.

**Click Here** to see if you qualify as a Beta Tester.

Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>",fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 18 Sep 2002 14:13:32 -0400",Re: [VoID] a new low on the personals tip...,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'd suggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is showing up, right? Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which, as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker: ""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...) But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um, lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist congregation is about as orthogonal to my present congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in. I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing with them. :-). Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal. I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was just looking to make friends as I was new in town. The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a room... That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age, looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women. You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics - -- but I won't go there, I promise. If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...

Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or something). Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I would suggest tossing qmail-scanner  and SpamAssassin  into the mix as well. The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter does its work (including razor-check invocations). Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find out how to do that, go to  (which, incidentally, should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for ""qmail newbie's guide to relaying"". - Adrian ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

 Null, the third beta was out last week.

 It'll be an interesting release. Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,
large projects.

 I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...

 Though many say ""RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish"" - it's worth baring in
mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not
just the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.

Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended up taking a very different route: TMDA (http://www.tmda.net).  In particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to the messages I send to specific lists. For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:  to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda which rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question is able to send mail to). 				  -+- Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.   Reasons:   nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on   a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls   getservbyname() which does a lookup against ""smtp"" in /etc/services).   Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead   of SMTP.   Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not   recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail   delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use   sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:     .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv   which creates problems:     Postfix does not support ""-bv"" and returns in error     Exim does not support ""-t"" with ""-bv"" and returns in error     Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.   ""whom"" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.       It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout     about this.  The ""-bv"" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to     being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.     Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a     non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's     current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in     /etc/services) is a pain. I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's ""whom"" support using Exim's system filter:   0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:     DATADIR     ALLOW_MODE_640     CRYPT_KEY_FILE     FINGERPRINT   1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group ""mail"".   2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.   3) Set the following options in exim.conf:     message_filter = ""/etc/exim/filter""     message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe   4) /etc/exim/filter reads:     # Exim filter     testprint ""local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}""     testprint ""domain: ${domain: $h_From:}""     if ""$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:"" is """" and         ""${domain: $h_From:}"" is ""kanga.nu"" and        ""${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}"" is ""true""     then       pipe ""/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config""       finish     endif   Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that   they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for   your setup. Basic explanation:   Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is   configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter   extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru   that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.   The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement   for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different   user, chgrp as appropriate.   It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I   haven't investigated that end. Notes:   This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA   has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),   and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If   you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for   other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so   don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if   you wish.   A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail   servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA   support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less   complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA   configuration. Caveat Emptor.     ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a   ""hold"" delivery method (identical to ""confirm"" except it sends no   confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing   silent sidetracking of mail). --  J C Lawrence                 ---------(*)                Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas.  claw@kanga.nu               He lived as a devil, eh?		   http://www.kanga.nu/~claw/  Evil is a name of a foeman, as I live. _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users",0,1

SpamAssassin here so that our users understand it.

I define ""Solicited Commercial Email"" vs ""Unsolicited Commercial Email"" -
the latter being SPAM. As SpamAssassin basically looks for ""Commercial
Email"", both get hit, and that's something they must understand.

Our SA documentation further tells users to filter off their SCE before
applying a SA rule - gets rid of 100% of the problem as the users know who
is sending them SCE.

Every new Mac comes with an upgrade 10.2 CD as of last week.
So if you bought one on the 12th, you'd be running 10.2 before the release
this Friday night.

Good luck with that, even Mac geeks have a longer upgrade cycle than the
average PC user, but you'd never know...

Yup, I've been meaning to cobble together procmail + script for this, as 
a few Google searches didn't turn up anything. Did anyone here get there 
first?

(I guess I want a config file of mailboxes who normally sign their mail, 
and procmail that runs gpg and adds headers...)

FWIW, the 'Enigmail' add-on for Mozilla's mail client has it happily 
talking to GPG (and I believe PGP). You can choose how long it remembers 
your passphrase for, default is 15 mins.

see http://enigmail.mozdev.org/

This feature was enough to get my off my Pine habit, since (to answer 
the original question) the combination of SpamAssassin and shared 
whitelists means that forged 'From:' headers are pretty much the only 
spam I see in my inbox now.

**Our last pick Symphony Telecom (OTCBB: SYPY) went UP 100% in just one

_InDigiNet Identifies Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35
Million..._



**Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate**

The Wall Street Bulletin believes that the recent investment of capital into
Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, is further proof of the continued validity of
the telecommunication market when looked at from the perspective of the small
to mid-sized enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future
may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to
remain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. ""Every major
industry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar
transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the
mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert
Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.
Christopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all the people
that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving
carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few
millions."" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the
link at the end of this newsletter._

As we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)
has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As
InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this
company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.
This could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our
Highest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.



**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**

We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.
A similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),
share price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over
$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously
had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267
million.

IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for
potential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a
few months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an
increase of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time
is right for investors to get in on the ground floor.



**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**

InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-
sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet
is a prestigious ""Diamond"" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for
Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to
offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building
a communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer
bases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its
acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then
expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance
profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data
services and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and
this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten
years. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.

The IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com



**The __ IT Market**

Based on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag
significantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including
Internet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT
spending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7
percent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market
researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.
In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in
the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436
billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect
growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will
experience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market
will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,
India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_



**Particulars**

The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth
recommendation list for the following reasons:

1\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,
single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the
acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution
channel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,
wireless, and data.

  
2\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range
communities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the
value of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing
campus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic
Committee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.

  
3\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to
acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and
smaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the
targeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to
purchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.



**Investment Consideration**

InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,
2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1
2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for
their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and
more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to
small to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars.

the refund delivery method on the amount.  yesh, it's silly to spend $.37 (+
labor and materials) for a $.02 refund, but maybe the only alternative right
now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep
the money (see john hall below).  your mailed refund is a function of bulk.

in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service
and over-charging.  what will probably happen: if the amount of overage per
customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the
customer.  If it's less, the combined total amount will go to the city as
lump sum settlement.

in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like
their lump sum to go.  of courese, they'd have to be notified by mail first.

They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an
insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
$.02.

Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
starts adding up.

guido@python.org (Guido van Rossum),,"Fri, 06 Sep 2002 10:31:22 -0400",[Spambayes] Deployment,"Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
think about deployment.

Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
as a filter.

A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).

There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:

- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You
  configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then
  point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it
  receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads
  your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only
  need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that
  anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.

- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message
  and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"".  Then you have a little program
  that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The
  server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the
  scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle
  would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe
  marshalling.)

- Your idea here.

Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The Perl
Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

Dear sirs or Madams,
We are one Arcyl bathtub manufacturer in China.

-----------------Profile-----------------------

Our factoryspecializes in manufacturing YEMA brand acrylic composite bathtubs, we have more than 10 years experience of bathtub manufacturing and marketing. With 
our considerable experience we set out to blend the advantages of all the other of bathtubs offered in the market place into one range. After several years 
development we produced our current range and the YEMA brand bathtub was patented in 2001. We were even awarded the ""Gold Medal"" in the ""Chinese Patent Technology 
Exhibition"" and ""The Ninth Chinese New Patent Technology and New Patent Product Exhibition"" later that year. The YEMA bathtubs structural design is that of a normal 
acrylic bathtub but conglutinated into a composite material. It is ridged and is made more than twice as thick as a normal unit, making it more smooth, gentle and 
elegant. This manufacturing technique not only provides all the advantages of a normal acrylic bathtub (easily to clean, resistance to dirt, colorful,attractive etc) 
but also provides increased heat retention, and extends the products life span.

Besides our products on website, we now produce some new models for USA market. We also produce shower panels with finest quality.

It's still doing it.  I reported a message as spam 10 minutes ago and
the check keeps coming back false.  What's funny is that message that
I'm testing with it the sample-spam.txt message from SpamAssassin and I
know it's been reported before.

Hi,

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
specially with regards to false-positives.

cheers,
vipul.

|

|   | **Learn To Sell With the Complete eBay Auction** **Marketing e-Course**

**Here's YOUR Chance To Join The Online Selling Revolution And EARN A FULL
TIME INCOME!**

**Our eBay Marketing e-Course will show you how to create HUGE profits selling
on eBay!**  
  
---|---  
  
* * *

Do you sell on eBay? If so, you could be making up to $100,000 per month.  
  
This is no hype and no scam. Receiving over 1.5 billion page views per month,
eBay is the ULTIMATE venue for selling virtually anything and making huge
profits with almost no effort. But you have to know what to sell and how to
sell. That's where I come in.  
  
As a leading expert in internet marketing and the owner of several profitable
auction-based businesses, the manual that I have written provides easy to
understand and detailed instructions for maximizing your profits with selling
strategies that are PROVEN WINNERS.  
  
If you've read any other books on eBay, you know that all of them are designed
for the computer idiot and the auction novice. They tell you how to register,
how to list an item, how to avoid fraud, etc. This is not the information you
need to make millions on eBay. You need to learn effective SELLING STRATEGIES
not read a photocopy of eBay help files! My manual assumes that you already
know your way around eBay; you don't need any specialized computer knowledge,
but you should be familiar with buying and selling on eBay auctions. I'm not
going to waste your time teaching you how to register - I'm going to pass on
the SECRET SELLING TECHNIQUES that I use each and every day to bring in
hundreds of thousands of dollars selling my products on internet auctions. The
manual comes as a complete course with the following lessons:

**Make a Fortune on eBay**  
Make a Fortune on eBay is filled with page after page of vital eBay marketing
information. This valuable e-Book is terrific for the eBay user to get the
right eBay information and have an instant edge over other more experienced
eBay Sellers

**Advanced Selling on eBay**  
Advanced Selling on eBay has more vital information to make their auction a
success. This e-Book has many topics to ensure that they get the maximum
potential from their auctions.Advanced Selling on eBay goes into more detailed
information than it's sister e-Book Make a Fortune on eBay.

**16 eBay Forms  
**""16 eBay Forms"" is a must. These forms will help them track, analyze and
record their auctions. It contains 16 forms with full instructions. This
E-Book also contains the forms in printer friendly version, so they can print
them for immediate use.

**Wholesale Sources  
**Wholesale Sources is the final e-Book in the eBay Marketing e-Course. It
contains wholesale distributors from the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Asia and the Philippines. Armed with this e-Book your customers will
have over 10,000,000 wholesale products at their finger tips..

This manual is designed for individuals looking to form an online business for
extra income or as a full-time job making hundreds of thousands of dollars on
eBay. Contained in the manual are WINNING STRATEGIES for selling on eBay
auctions. The manual is not designed for eBay novices and does not teach the
""basics"" such as registering, putting an item online, buying an item, etc.
This manual is designed to make eBay users into successful and wealthy
entrepreneurs!  
  

Not only will you be able to make THOUSANDS with the information in these
e-Books, you will also receive FULL Resellers rights. This is not an affiliate
program where you get 20 or 30%... you keep all the money generated from your
e-Course sales.

You can sell this e-Course as many times as you want for whatever price you
choose. There is NO LIMIT on how much you can make from this incredible
product!  

|

Sell these e-Books individually or as a complete e-Course. Give ""Make a
Fortune on eBay"" for free and use ""Advanced Selling on eBay"", ""16 eBay Forms""
and ""Wholesale Sources"" as a sell up.

I do not have the time to follow the compiler ""wars"", but I notice that I
must use egcs to build 64 bit SPARC code.

GCC 3 should do it, but because it is so ""buggy""[1] it is not worth trying
to use unless you really want to track down those compiler errors... :(

- Matthew

[1] ""buggy"" in the sense that its a feature. Many of the problems with GCC 3
seem to be related to stricter syntax checking. More accurate information
will be appreciated.

Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents of slaves, who were brought here by force. More stuff, cheaper. That's progress. Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in wealth has nothing to do with it. It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is statistical sophistry. Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes 400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point, they're nowhere near the top. I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself, in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges, and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA. In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly"" distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general -- economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more people living longer. I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.

It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
this may hold true for other European countries as well.  

After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.

 University boom creates era of sexual tolerance

 By Helen Rumbelow
 
 
 
 THE boom in university education has led to a sea change in Britains
 tolerance of homosexuality, according to a report. Just under half the people
 now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong, down from three
 quarters 15 years ago, according to the British Social Attitudes survey,
 regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion. 
 
 That trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities, with 75 per
 cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced, compared
 with 60 per cent in 1987. 
 
 Geoffrey Evans, a politics professor at Oxford University, decided to focus on
 what has caused Britain to become more open-minded in a report published
 today. The study, from the National Centre for Social Research, is based on
 interviews with a cross-section of 3,500 people. 
 
 Young people are much more tolerant than their elders, with a quarter of
 twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong, compared with
 two thirds of pensioners. 
 
 But the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college, with
 graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs, and a
 third less racist. 
 
 That transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from
 and, with 41 per cent of young people now attending university, it was a
 powerful social effect, Professor Evans said. 
 
 Mr Blairs famous mantra education, education, education seems far less
 consequential now than when first announced in 1997, as Britain struggles with
 an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people
 get degrees, degrees buy less and less, he said. 
 
 But the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the
 undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance, he added. 
 
 He decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just
 political correctness by testing how many civil rights the educated would
 give to an unattractive minority: white supremacists. 
 
 Again, people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and
 university, with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists
 should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections,
 three times as many as those with no qualifications. 
 
 It is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant, the report
 says, adding that it may be simply because university students have increased
 contact with alternative points of view. 
 
 Professor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their
 idealism, but found the opposite to be true. 
 
 Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong
 with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties. He
 said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older
 generation, Britain would become an ever more relaxed place. 
 
 Soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability, with more than half
 the country wanting cannabis to be legalised, compared with a third seven
 years ago. That is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread,
 with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it. 
 
 A third of Labour voters, twice as many as Conservatives, had tried the drug,
 and being young, living in London and having a degree also increased the
 chances. 
 
 One issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs. Most take a strong position on
 heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years. Now the proportion of
 people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept
 up to 97 per cent. 
 
 The views on heroin show that Britain is by no means becoming a liberal
 free-for-all, Alison Park, co-director of the study, said. People are making
 quite a clear distinction between what they think (of) as right and wrong. 
 
 On other matters, the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think
 that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits  in
 fact, they account for 6 per cent; that union membership has fallen by a fifth
 in the past 18 years, with just under a third of workers in a union; and that
 half those questioned oppose secondary school selection. In 1984 the figure
 was 40 per cent. 
 
 The survey also indicates that 19 per cent of men aged between 25 and 34 live
 with their parents, twice as many as women.

A New Theory on Mapping the New World

By Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07

In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
""America."" With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.
Did someone get there earlier?

Anybody else having this problem? I'll take the blame. The reason, I suspect, is that we're needlessly reading the .sequences file  multiple times because of other sequences.

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 information

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Hi, First of all, sorry for not replying to your private email from last week, but I really don't have a slight idea of what could be causing this! - Is this with different DVDs or a single one? - Is this using OSS or ALSA? Have you tried both? - Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones?

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

The people who built the Ximian version of RedHat used a system similar to said tarball. Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports system rather than rpm, deb or whatever would complicate things a tad more IMHO. It *is* a good idea though.  I've been  wondering about the same thing for a couple of months now but always considered it too complicated to carry out. (If that makes any sense at all). I don't discount any other work like for  example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe there is general interest in an Irish distro. Anyone?

There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right? Right. Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure  in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other),  no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places  such a suggestion would stumble.

**Techs slump with Intel**  
With investors selling Intel shares before its post-market close earnings
announcement, technology stocks dropped Tuesday.

Despite generally upbeat remarks on the economy by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan
and news of a profitable quarter from Nextel Communications, CNET's Tech index
slipped 12.4 points, or 1.25 percent, to 992.91. The tech-laden Nasdaq
composite index fell 7.36 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.26.

Worse-than-expected earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar
helped depress broader markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166.0
points, or 1.92 percent, to 8,473.1--for its seventh consecutive losing
session. The S&P; 500 shed 16.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 900.94--another
multi-year low.

**Microsoft reveals media XP details**  
Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows
XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which
will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs
and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With
Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to

**Intel layoffs possible**  
Chipmaker Intel may be on the verge of announcing massive layoffs or other
cuts amid a slow market for personal computers, according to reports. Intel
CEO Craig Barrett is scheduled to speak to employees after stock markets close
Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal. At about the same time, the
chipmaker will discuss its second-quarter results on a conference call with
analysts.

**Nextel Turns Profitable, Revenues Jump**  
Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's No. 5 wireless telephone company, on
Tuesday said it turned profitable in its second quarter, driven by strong
customer demand that translated to a 25 percent revenue increase. Nextel also
said it expected 2002 operating cash flow of at least $3 billion compared with
an earlier forecast calling for $2.5 billion.

Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is
building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than
traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes
Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply
products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power
supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't
need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large,
untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee
suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely
to rise much in the short term.

Yet half of those polled believed that humans and dinosaurs co-existed on Earth, despite the scientific fact that the dinosaurs went extinct tens of millions of years before the earliest hominids appeared. Worse, only 22% of the respondents understood what a molecule - for example, carbon dioxide - is. As in the case of the belief by many that dinosaurs and early humans co-existed, public opinion does not change the actual facts about the material world. Such a poll measures nothing more than the degree of public ignorance about scientific matters. Most people get news stories about science and technology developments from television. And after more than a decade of being fed what-if stories about global warming from human activities, no wonder most people ""believe"" that global warming ""will"" occur. However, on the anxiety scale, only 33% ""worry a great deal"" about global warming, a worry that ranks at 12 out of 13 environmental concerns. The top environmental fear, shared by 64% of those polled, was polluted drinking water. So What Do We Know? Concerning the latest understanding on human-made global warming, here are three points we know from the science:    1. The surface record of temperature from thermometers show widespread warming in the 20th century compared to the 19th. There was one period of warming early in the 20th century, the second after the 1970s. Ecosystems have responded to this widespread warmth, not seen since ca. 800 - 1200 C.E.       But the cause of global surface warming cannot be associated with human activity without additional information. Some media reports point to ecosystem responses of 20th century warmth (e.g., mountain glacier retreat) and unjustifiably claim the responses owe to man-made causes. But mountain glaciers receded during the past period of warmth around 1,000 years ago, and advanced during the unusual cold of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300 - 1900 C.E.). Both those climate shifts occurred naturally, before the increased concentration of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.     # All computer simulations of climate say that in order to conclude that the surface global warming trend is human caused, the surface warmth must be accompanied by an equal or larger warming trend in the air from one to five miles in height. Measurements made by satellites and verified from weather balloons show no meaningful human-made warming trend over the last two or even four decades. Thus, the recent warming trend in the surface temperature record cannot be caused by the increase of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.     # The computer simulations are not reliable as tools for explaining past climate or making projections for future trends. Future Shock: The Scenarios When it comes to future scenarios, consider what the experts actually say about potential climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change writes in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (2000), ""Scenarios are images of the future or alternative futures. They are neither predictions nor forecasts."" Further, ""The possibility that any single emissions path will occur as described in the scenario is highly uncertain,"" and finally, ""No judgement is offered in this Report as to the preference for any of the scenarios and they are not assigned probabilities of occurrence, neither must they be interpreted as policy recommendations."" Forecasting future societal conditions and energy use often amount to little more than unconvincing guesses. Jesse Ausebel at Rockefeller University in April 2002 critiqued the U.N. IPCC's "" ... 40 energy scenarios, with decarbonization, or carbonization, sloping every which way and no probabilities attached. ... It is a confession that collectively they know nothing, that no science underlies their craft, and that politics strongly bias their projections."" Nonetheless, such a guess about the world's energy future forms the first step in making a 100-year prediction of global warming. That first uncertain forecast - future energy use - used as input in the climate simulation surely compounds the uncertainty in the next step, the climate forecast. Inability to predict the future should not be surprising. The climate simulations upon which predictions are based yield unreliable results because, as outlined above, the results are incompatible with measurements of how the climate has changed in the last few decades. Complete Speculation On May 24, 1994, Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at MIT, testified to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, ""The claims about catastrophic consequences of significant global warming, should it occur at all, are almost completely speculative. Not only are they without any theoretical foundations, but they frequently involved assuming the opposite of what appears to happen."" Despite years of solid work by climate specialists, the output of computer simulations remains undependable, owing to the extraordinary complexity of the natural world. Thus, on May 1, 2001 Lindzen testified to the Senate Commerce Committee about the long-standing inability of computer simulations to deliver results that resemble reality, even in the cases where good measurements are available: ""For example, there is widespread agreement [among climate scientists] ... that large computer climate models are unable to even simulate major features of past climate such as the 100 thousand year cycles of ice ages that have dominated climate for the past 700 thousand years, and the very warm climates of the Miocene [23 to 5 million years ago], Eocene [57 to 35 million years ago], and Cretaceous [146 to 65 million years ago]. Neither do they do well at accounting for shorter period and less dramatic phenomena like El Ninos, quasi-biennial oscillations, or intraseasonal oscillations - all of which are well documented in the data, and important contributors to natural variability."" Lindzen explained the failure of computer simulations simply in May 2000: ""The point I am making is that it is a fallacious assumption that the models have everything in them, and will display it, and somehow the rest is just technical uncertainty. There are things they literally don't have."" This punctuates the popular notion that averaging output from computer results will somehow, miraculously, give a scientifically appropriate result. Think Locally Now, on top of the unreliable forecasts of global warming -- which rest on ""highly uncertain"" forecasts of future economic and social conditions and un-validated climate simulations -- come the forecasts of local impacts, in order to make the case for relevancy to people. Increased storminess is one prediction of the outcome of human-made global warming found in the popular media, which would be where most people learn about the issue. The idea that storminess increases with human-made global warming defies expert opinion. David Legates, an expert hydrology researcher, testified in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on March 13, 2002: ""Ascertaining anthropogenic changes to these extreme weather events is nearly impossible. Climate models cannot even begin to simulate storm-scale systems, let alone model the full range of year-to-year variability... Clearly, claims that anthropogenic global warming will lead to more occurrences of droughts, floods, and storms are wildly exaggerated."" The U.N. IPCC Third Assessment Report concurs, ""[T]here is currently insufficient information to assess recent trends, and climate models currently lack the spatial detail required to make confident projections. For example, very small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail and lightning, are not simulated in climate models (Summary for Policymakers, p. 15)."" A group of extremely relevant experts, the American Association of State Climatologists, recently summarized the state of climate simulations: ""Climate prediction is complex with many uncertainties ... For time scales of a decade or more, understanding the empirical accuracy of such predictions - called ""verification"" - is simply impossible, since we have to wait a decade or longer to assess the accuracy of the forecasts. ... climate predictions have not demonstrated skill in projecting future variability and changes in such important climate conditions as growing season, drought, flood-producing rainfall, heat waves, tropical cyclones and winter storms. These are the type of events that have a more significant impact on society than annual average global temperature trends."" On the facts of human-made global warming, should one believe television or the experts? --  ----------------- R. A.

_Shelley Powers_: &#8220;I thought the stuff this weekend on FOAF was a joke[1]
&#8212;a bunch of people playing with new toys. ... How does FOAF aid 
aggregation? The author is included with each bit. Why do we need extraneous 
material such as college, and who the author knows?&#8221; 

_Seth Russell_: &#8220;For example I wanted to know who _you_ were[2]. Only 
thing I had was your posts to this list. So i found ""burningbird.net"" in your 
email address ... then i did a lot of reading over there. Still don't really 
know who your are and what you are into, what projects you are working on, who 
you know, and why you came here to run your mouth. But if there were a foaf 
button on the feed from this channel, well I just click on that and i'm totally 
into your stuff.&#8221;
